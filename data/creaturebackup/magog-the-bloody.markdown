***Nimble Escape.*** The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

**Actions**

***Sneak Attack*** If Magog has advantage on an attack, or the opponent he is attacking is within 5 ft of an ally that is not incapacitated, Magog does an extra 6d6 damage. He can only do this extra damage once per turn.

***Multiattack.*** The goblin makes two attacks with its scimitar or its shortbow.

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.

***Short Bow.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage.

**Reactions**

***Redirect Attack.*** When a creature the goblin can see targets it with an attack, the goblin chooses another goblin within 5 feet of it. The two goblins swap places, and the chosen goblin becomes the target instead.
