***Charge.*** If the goat moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Sure-Footed.*** The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

**Actions**

***Ram.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

***Stare.*** The goat stares at its target. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom Save or be frightened of the goat. This effect lasts until the target can no longer see the goat, at which point it can make a new saving throw at the end of its turn each round. On a success the target is no longer afraid.
