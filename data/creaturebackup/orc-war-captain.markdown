**Orc War Machine Creature** This creature is built for the Orc War Machine. Proficiency bonus is based on hit dice rather than CR, weapons and armor are set up for a professional military.

**Squad Leader.** A typical orc squad is led by a war captain. The war captain will then have at his disposal 3 elites of a type depending on the squads mission, and 6 lesser orc soldiers. So an archery squad would have a captain with 3 orc elite archers and 6 orc archers. An attack squad would be led by a captain with 3 trained berserkers and 6 soldiers, and a defensive squad would be a captain with 3 elite guards and 6 orc spearmen. Occassionaly a unit will also have a War Cleric or Battle Sorcerer attached to it as well, typically in a co-equal role with the War Captain rather than as a subordinate.
