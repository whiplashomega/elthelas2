Using a new ritual developed by the Prince of Fiends himself, the orcs have discovered a way to make stronger, larger, winged drakes from the scales of their black dragon allies. Almost as large as a young black dragon, but maturing in a fraction of the time it would take to even raise a horse. These drakes are then given heavy barding and riden by elite goblin riders as scouts and raiders.
