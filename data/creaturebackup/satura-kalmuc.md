***Cunning Action.*** Can dash, disengage, or hide as a bonus action on her turn.

***Evasion.*** Satura can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When she is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if she fails.

***Uncanny Dodge.*** when an attacker that she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her reaction to halve the attack’s damage against her.

***Sneak Attack.*** Can do an additional 4d6 weapon damage if she hits with a weapon attack on her turn, once per turn and has advantage on the attack or an ally adjacent to the target and does not have disadvantage.

***Bladesong.*** Satura can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that she isn't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces her with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

She can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if she is incapacitated, if she dons medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if she uses two hands to make an attack with a weapon. She can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time she chooses (no action required).

While her Bladesong is active, she gains the following benefits:

* She gains a bonus to her AC equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
* Her walking speed increases by 10 feet.
* She has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
* She gains a bonus to any Constitution saving throw she makes to maintain her concentration on a spell. The bonus equals her Intelligence modifier (minimum of +l).
