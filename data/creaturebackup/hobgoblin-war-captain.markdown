**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Javelin.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft. of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.

**Orc War Machine Creature** This creature is built for the Orc War Machine. Proficiency bonus is based on hit dice rather than CR, weapons and armor are set up for a professional military.
