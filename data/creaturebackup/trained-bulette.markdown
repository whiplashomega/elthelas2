***Standing Leap.*** The bulette's long jump is up to 30 ft. and its high jump is up to 15 ft., with or without a running start.

**Actions**

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage.

***Deadly Leap.*** If the bulette jumps at least 15 ft. as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its ft. in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 ft. out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space.

**Orc War Machine Creature** This creature is built for the Orc War Machine. Proficiency bonus is based on hit dice rather than CR, weapons and armor are set up for a professional military.
