      "description": "Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.\n\n####Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips known column o f the Druid table.\n\n####Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n####Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells."

You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. You start knowing three forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed. You can select different forms when you finish a long rest, and your maximum number of forms increases as you gain druid levels (see the Beast Shapes table).\n\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n* You gain the actions, traits, armor class, speed, strength, dexterity, constitution, senses, resistances, and immunities of the chosen creature.\n* You gain temporary hit points equal to the sum of the creature's hit points and protection points. You lose any remaining temporary hit points when the wild shape ends, additionally if you lose all of these tempoary hit points, the wild shape ends early.\n* You may need to recalculate the skill, save, and attack bonuses of the creature if its proficiency bonus is different than yours. For example, a brown bear has a strength of 19, and a proficiency bonus of 2, giving it an attack bonus of +6. If you have a proficiency bonus of 3, while wild shaped as a brown bear you would instead have an attack bonus of +7. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n* You can’t cast spells and your ability to take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form, however you retain the ability to speak normally, as well as gaining the ability to speak and understand beasts of the type to which you are wildshaped. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class or background (but not ancestry, except proficiencies provided by your ancestry or darkvision) and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. \n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn or carried by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear or carry must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\n\n#### Beast Shapes\nDruid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed\n_____________________\n2nd | 3 | 1/4 | No\n4th | 4 | 1/2 | No\n8th | 5 | 1 | Yes"
