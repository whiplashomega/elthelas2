      "description": "Starting at 2nd level, you start to pick up the intricacies of casting spells. As a student of magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that you have picked up in your travels.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt 2nd level, you know four cantrips of your choice from any spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Factotum table.\n\n#### Spellbook\n\nAt 2nd level you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level spells of your choice.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Factotum table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so choose a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your intelligence modifier + one half of your factotum level (rounded down, minimum of 1 spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you're a 5th-level factotum, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing incantations and gestures you must make to cast a spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier.\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus or a divine focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your spells.\n\n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\nEach time you gain a Factotum level after 2nd, you can add one spell of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Factotum table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar)."
