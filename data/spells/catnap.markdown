**3rd-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: S, M (a pinch of sand)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "10d8", label: "necrotic", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.
