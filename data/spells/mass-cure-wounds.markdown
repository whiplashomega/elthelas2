**5th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "3d8", label: "healing", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": true, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "1d8" } ]

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
