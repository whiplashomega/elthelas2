You create a weapon made of pure of force in your hand that exists for the duration. The weapon is a one-handed melee weapon that does 1d6 force damage and adds your 
spellcasting modifier to attack rolls and damage modifiers instead of strength or dexterity. Its appearance can be that of any 1-handed melee weapon, the weapon is 
weightless, and if you let go of the weapon for any reason the spell ends early. You can only have one force weapon at a time. If you attempt to summon a second force weapon 
the first will disappear and be replaced by the second one.
