**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirits space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore ld6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit canâ€™t heal constructs or undead. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the Spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

**Errata Clarification** The spell ends once the spirit has restored hit points a number of times equal to three times your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
