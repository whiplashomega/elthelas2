Dropping to 0 Hit Points
        <p>
          When you drop to 0 hit points, you gain the Dying condition.
        </p>
        <h5>Instant Death</h5>
        <p>
          Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.
        </p>
        <h5>Death Saving Throws</h5>
        <p>
          Whenever you have the dying condition, you may use your action make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll a d20. If the roll is 16 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success ends the dying condition and you gain 1 hit point. A failure has no effect on its own, but as the dying condition applies increasing levels of exhaustion you will creep closer and closer to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you immediately roll on the injury table for the damage type and adjudicate the effects. You cannot have fewer than 0 hit points.
        </p>
        <h5>Optional Rule: Injury</h5>
        <p>
          Your DM may opt to use the injury table. If they do, when you drop to 0 hit points due to damage, roll on the injury table for the damage type that dropped you to 0 hit points. To do so, you roll a d100 and add your constitution score. Compare the result to the table, and apply the listed effect to your character.
        </p>
        <h5>Monsters and Death</h5>
        <p>
          Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it take the dying condition and make death saving throws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.
