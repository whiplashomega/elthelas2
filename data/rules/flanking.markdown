Movement and Positioning
Flanking

When positioning yourself in combat it is important not to let enemies surround you because you can't watch them all at once. Similarly, if you can manage to surround your enemies, you have the ability to do additional damage.

If both you and an ally have an enemy within your reach, and you can draw a line from you to your ally that crosses opposite sides of an opponents space, that enemy gains the **Flanked** condition. Remember, this applies to you too! If you are within the reach of two or more enemies, and those enemies can draw a line through your space that crosses opposite sides, you gain the flanked condition as well.
