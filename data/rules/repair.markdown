Repair Armor
<p>
  You can use an action to make quick repairs to a suit of armor you or a character within 1m of you is wearing. To do so, make an ability check with tools appropriate for repairing the armor in question that you have in hand. On a success you can expend the repair kit and restore 2d4+2 protection points for that suit of armor. Appropriate tools might be smithing tools, tinkers tools, or leatherworkers tools, but depending on the specific suit of armor your DM might determine a different tool set is appropriate.
