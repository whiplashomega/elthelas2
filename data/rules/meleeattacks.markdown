Combat
Making an Attack
Melee Attacks
<p>
  Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

<h4>Reach</h4>
<p>
  A creatures reach is determined by its size and its weapons. The table below shows the reach of a creature based on its size. When casting a spell with a range of touch, or making an unarmed strike, this is the reach the creature has. When a creature is wielding a weapon its reach may be extended for effects that rely on that weapon (such as an opportunity attack). To determine a creatures reach while wielding a weapon, check the table below and add the weapons reach to the value in the weapon reach modification column for its size. This assumes the creature is using an instance of that weapon designed for a creature its size.
