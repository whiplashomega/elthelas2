Wisdom Checks
<p>
  A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as w hen searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to apply first aid to a wounded ally or diagnose an illness.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.
</p>
<p>
  For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orc s lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.
</p>
<h5>Hearing at a Distance</h5>
<p>
  Your ability to hear something depends on how loud the thing is, the ambient noise where you are, the distance between you and the source of the sound, and the amount of detail you are trying to make out. Start with the below baseline table for distance and noise level to DC. A player should only need to roll a perception check if the required DC is higher than their passive perception.
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead><tr><th></th><th>0 - 18m</th><th>18m - 36m</th><th>36m - 90m</th><th>90m - 300m</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Quiet (whisper)</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td><td>DC 30</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Normal (conversation, verbal spell components)</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Loud (shouting, combat)</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Very Loud (thunderwave, airplane noise)</td><td>DC -5</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 10</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
From there make additional modifications to the DC based on ambient noise and detail based on the guidance below:
<ul>
  <li>No or little ambient noise, for example outdoors with a little birdsong or perhaps in a quiet library - reduce the DC by 2</li>
  <li>Reasonable noise levels, for example background conversations in a shop or a musician playing in an otherwise empty bar - no modification</li>
  <li>Loud background noises, such as a busy pub or the sounds of combat, increase the DC by 2</li>
  <li>Very loud background noise, such as explosions, increase the DC by 5</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Only need to perceive that a noise occurred - reduce the DC by 5</li>
  <li>Low detail required, such as identifying someones voice (but not what they are saying) - reduce the DC by 2</li>
  <li>Moderate detail required, getting the gist of a conversation without making out every word - normal DC</li>
  <li>High detail required, for example identifying a spell by its verbal component, getting a conversation correct word for word - increase the DC by 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  So, for example, a very common occurance may be that your wizard wants to identify a spell that is being cast before casting counterspell. He is within 18m (the range of counterspell) and the noise is of normal volume, so the base DC is 5. The background noise is loud (DC + 2) and the level of detail required is high (DC + 3). Making this a DC 10 check. Thankfully, our wizard has a passive perception of 10, and so he does not need to roll. However, if his passive perception were less than 10 (for example if he had a very low wisdom score) he may be required to roll in order to hear what the enemy caster is saying and thus know what spell is being cast.
</p>
<p>
  Another common scenario maybe the case of the nighttime ambush. Most of the party is sleeping when the person on watch gets attacked. He shouts to try to wake up his compatriots. The sleeping wizard has a passive perception of 5, he took a -5 because he is sleeping and thus has disadvantage on perception checks. The ranger on watch is 20 meters away, making the base DC 10. There is little or no ambient noise (it is the quiet of night) and he only needs to perceive that the noise occured to be awakened, but probably needs moderate detail to understand why he was awakened. Therefore the DC to be awakened by the shout is 3 (so no check required) and the DC to understand that the ranger is warning them of danger is 8.
</p>
<h5>Finding a Hidden Object</h5>
<p>
  When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
</p>
<p>
  In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
  <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
</ul>
