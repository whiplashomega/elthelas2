Wisdom Checks
        <p>
          A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as w hen searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orc s lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.
        </p>
        <h5>Finding a Hidden Object</h5>
        <p>
          When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
          <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
        </ul>
