Making an Attack
Parrying an Attack
<p>
  If you take the attack action on your turn, you can forgo one attack you would otherwise make as part of that action to Parry. When you parry you do not provoke an opportunity attack the next time you would provoke one. For example, if you are looking to close with an enemy in order to attack them, but they have longer reach than you, you would provoke an opportunity attack by moving closer to them, however you can avoid that opportunity attack by giving up one of your attacks. If you later in the same round provoke another opportunity attack, for example by then attempting to move out of an opponents reach, you still provoke as normal.

  When you parry, the opponents reaction is not expended, and you must parry before you know whether or not the opponent will choose to make an opportunity attack.
