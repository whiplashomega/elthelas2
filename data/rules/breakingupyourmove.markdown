Breaking up Your Move
<p>
  You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 9m, you can move 3m, take your action, and then move 6m.
</p>
<h5>Moving Between Attacks</h5>
<p>
  If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 7m could move 3m, make an attack, move 4m, and then attack again.
</p>
<h5>Using Different Speeds</h5>
<p>
  If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you have a speed of 9m and a flying speed of 18m because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 6m, then walk 3m, and then leap into the air to fly 9m more.
