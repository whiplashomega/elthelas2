Falling
<p>
  A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 3m it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

<p>
  If you fall in combat, it happens immediately on the turn in which the fall begins, up to 150m If you are still falling at that point, you descend an additional 150m at the end of your next turn unless something causes the fall to end (such as being caught, beginning to fly, or hitting the ground).
