Poisons
Poisons
<p>
  Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, draw, and other evil creatures.
</p>
<p>
  Poisons come in the following four types.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Contact.</strong> A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 5-foot cube.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Injury.</strong> A creature that takes slashing or piercing damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated with injury poison is exposed to its effects.
</p>
<h4>Purchasing Poison</h4>
<p>
  In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they track down the poison they seek.
</p>
<p>
  The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single doses of various poisons.
</p>
<h4>Crafting and Harvesting Poison</h4>
<p>
  During downtime between adventures, a character can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to create basic poison if the character has proficiency with a poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.
</p>
<p>
  A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.
