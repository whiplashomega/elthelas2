Movement
Moving on a Grid
Combat is typically managed using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, following these rules.

**Spaces.** Each space on the grid represents 1 meter.

**Speed.** Rather than moving meter by meter, move space by space on the grid. This means you use your speed in 1 meter segments.

**Entering a space.** To enter a space, you must have at least 1 space of movement left. If you are moving diagonally, each space requires 1.5 spaces of movement (rounding down). So the first diagonal takes 1 meter of movement, but if you move diagonally twice as part of your move the second will cost 2 meters of movement. If a space costs extra movement, as a space of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 spaces of movement left to enter a space of difficult terrain.

**Corners.** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

**Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting spaces from a space adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

**Areas of Effect** When determining the center point for an area of effect that specifies a radius, measure from a corner rather than a center point to determine what squares are affected.

##### Hex Grid

It is possible to use a hex grid instead of a square grid. When using a hex grid there are no diagonal moves, and all moves cost 1 space.

##### 1 Meter Grid Size.

When using a 1 meter grid size, make the following adjustments to the rules.

**Weapon Reach** Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and the *light* property instead have a 1 meter reach. This also applies to unarmed strikes. Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and do not have the *light* property should have a 2 meter reach. Weapons that have a 10 ft reach should instead have a 3 meter reach. Weapons that have a 15 ft reach should instead have a 4 meter reach.

**Weapon and Spell** Spells and weapons that have a range of touch should have a 1 meter range. Spells that have a range of 5 ft should have a 2 meter range. For all other spells, for every 10 ft give them a range of 3 meters, rounding down to the nearest meter (So 15 ft would be 4 meters).

**Areas of Effect** Areas of effect should round down to the nearest meter, using the 10 ft = 3 meters translation. Some common areas translated:
* 5 ft square - 1 m.
* 10 ft square (Faerie Fire) - 3 x 3 m.
* 15 ft cone (Burning Hands) - 4 meters across, by 4 meters long.
* 60 ft line 5 ft wide (i.e. Lightning Bolt) - 18 x 1 m
* 20 ft radius circle - 6 m radius.

**Speed** Treat speeds similarly to weapon and spell range. So a speed of 25 ft becomes 7 meters, 30 ft becomes 9 meters, 35 ft becomes 10 meters, and 60 ft becomes 18 meters.

**Space** When using a 1m space creature size becomes effectively smaller. This is to simplify space concerns and for increased compatibility with miniatures developed for the standard 5 ft space system.

* **Tiny** - 2 tiny creatures fit in a single 1 x 1 x 1 m space.
* **Small** - Small creatures fit 1 to a space.
* **Medium** - Medium creatures take up 1 space.
* **Large** - Large creatures would take up a 2 x 2 area.
* **Huge** - Huge creatures would take up a 3 x 3 area.
* **Gargantuan** - Gargantuan creatures would take up a 4 x 4.
* **Colossal** - Colossal creatures would take up at least a 5 x 5 area or more.
