Making an Attack
Attack Rolls
        <p>
          When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

        <h5>Modifiers to the Roll</h5>
        <p>
          When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ability Modifier.</strong> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

        <p>
          <strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.
        </p>
        <h5>Rolling 1 or 20</h5>
        <p>
          Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.
