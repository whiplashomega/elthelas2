Proficiency
        <p>
          A monsters proficiency bonus equals its hit dice / 4 (rounded up) + 1. So it follows the same pattern as player characters, 2 at 1-4 hit dice, 3 at 5-8 hit dice, 4 at 9-12 hit dice and so on.
        </p>
          <h4>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies</h4>
        <p>
          Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.

        <p>
          For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.
