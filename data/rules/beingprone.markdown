Being Prone
<p>
  Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed, rounded down. For example, if your speed is 9m, you must spend 4m of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

  To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every meter of movement while crawling costs 1 extra meter. Crawling 1 meter in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 meters of movement.
