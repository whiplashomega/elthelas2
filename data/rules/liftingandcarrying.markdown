Lifting and Carrying
<p>
  Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong> You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 1m.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Size and Strength.</strong> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
</p>
<h5>Variant: Encumbrance</h5>
<p>
  The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.
</p>
<p>
  If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 3m.
</p>
<p>
  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 6m and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
