Damage Types
        <p>
          Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.
        </p>
        <p>
          The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.
