Resting
<p>
  Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest--time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

  Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.
