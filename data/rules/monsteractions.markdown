Monster Rules
Actions
        <p>
          A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.
        </p>
        <h5>Melee and Ranged Attacks</h5>
        <p>
          The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creature vs. Target</strong> The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a "target" can be a creature or an object.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hit.</strong> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the "Hit" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Miss.</strong> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the "Miss:" notation.
        </p>
        <h5>Multiattack</h5>
        <p>
          A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.
        </p>
        <h5>Ammunition</h5>
        <p>
          A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.
        </p>
        <h4>Reactions</h4>
        <p>
          If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.
        </p>
        <h4>Limited Usage</h4>
        <p>
          Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>X/day.</strong>  The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, "1/Day" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Recharge X-Y.</strong> The notation "Recharge X–Y" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, "Recharge 5–6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</strong> This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.
        </p>
        <h4>Grapple Rules for Monsters</h4>
        <p>
          Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier.
