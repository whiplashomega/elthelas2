Exhaustion
        <p>While you are subjected to the Exhausted Condition you experience the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Levels of Exhaustion.</strong> This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds half of your constitution score (rounded up, minimum 2).</li>
          <li><strong>d20 Rolls Affected.</strong> When you make a d20 test (such as an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check), you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.</li>
          <li><strong>Spell Save DCs Affected.</strong> Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast, as well as the save DC for any class or racial abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Ending the Condition.</strong> Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer exhausted.</li>
        </ul>
