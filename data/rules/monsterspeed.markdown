Speed
<p>
  A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn.
</p>
<p>
  All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
</p>
<h5>Burrow</h5>
<p>
  A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
</p>
<h5>Climb</h5>
<p>
  A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.
</p>
<h5>Fly</h5>
<p>
  A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
</p>
<h5>Swim</h5>
<p>
  A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.
