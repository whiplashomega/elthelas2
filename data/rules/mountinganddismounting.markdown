Mounting and Dismounting
<p>
  A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
</p>
<p>
  Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 1m of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 9m, you must spend 4m of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 4m of movement left or if your speed is 0.
</p>
<p>
  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 1m of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
</p>
<p>
  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 1m it.
