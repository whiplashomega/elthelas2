  <li>On your turn you can take an action or a bonus action, but not both. If you take an action or bonus action, you immediately gain two levels of exhaustion, unless you use it to make a death saving throw.</li>
  <li>Each turn at the start of your turn you may use your action to roll a Death Saving Throw (DC 16, no ability modifier). If you succeed on the death saving throw the dying condition ends and you gain 1 hit point.</li>
  <li>Each turn at the end of your turn you gain 1 level of exhaustion.</li>
  <li>This condition ends if you gain any amount of hit points.</li>
</ul>
