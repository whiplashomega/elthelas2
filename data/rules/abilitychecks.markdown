Ability Checks
<p>
  An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

<p>
  For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

<h5>Typical Difficulty Classes</h5>
<table class="table table-sm">
  <thead><tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Very Hard</td><td>25</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nearly Impossible</td><td>30</td></tr>

<p>
  To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.
