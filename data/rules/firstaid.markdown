First Aid
<p>
  You can use an action to apply first aid to a character. To do so, make a DC 15 wisdom (medicine) check if you have a healers kit you can expend the healers kit to restore 2d4+2 hit points on a success. If you do not have a healers kit you can use this to remove the dying condition from a creature at 0 hit points but cannot restore hit points.
