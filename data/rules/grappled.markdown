          <li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler.</li>
          <li>The grappler can drag or carry you, but the grappler suffers the Slowed Condition while moving, unless you are at two or more sizes smaller than the grappler.</li>
          <li>While grappled, you can make a dexterity (acrobatics) or strength (athletics) check against the grapples escape DC or opposed by the grappler's strength (athletics) at the end of each of your turns, ending the condition on a success.
