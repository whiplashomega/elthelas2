Run
<p>
  When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals double your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 9m, for example, you can move up to 27m on your turn if you dash.
</p>
<p>
  Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 9m is reduced to 4m, for instance, you can move up to 12m this turn if you run.

  Additionally, when you take the run action, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls and dexterity saving throws, and all attack rolls have advantage to hit you until the end of your next turn. If you attempt to run for more than 1 minute, you must make a DC 10 constitution (athletics) check to continue running. You must make this check again for each minute that you continue running after that point, and each time you make the check the DC increases by 1. If you fail the check your exhaustion increases by 1 and you cannot take the run action until you complete a rest. This DC resets to 10 when you complete a rest.

  If you are riding a mount and your mount takes the run action, you and your mount both have disadvantage on attack rolls and dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls have advantage to hit both you and your mount.
