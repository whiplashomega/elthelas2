Combat
Making an Attack
Two-Weapon Fighting
<p>
  When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can make one extra attack as part of the same Action. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon in the other hand, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attacks damage. You can make this extra attack only once on each of your turns.

  For example, if you take the attack action on your turn and have a shortsword in one hand and a dagger in the other-each of which has the light property-you can make one attack with each weapon, but you don't add your strength or dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the second weapon.
