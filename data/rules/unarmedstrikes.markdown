Making an Attack
Unarmed Strike
<p>
  An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple,or shove a target within your reach (typically 1 meter for a medium or small creature). Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Damage.</strong> You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to hit equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grapple.</strong> You make a strength (athletics) check contested by the targets strength (athletics) or dexterity (acrobatics). If you succeed the target gains the Grappled condition. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Shove.</strong> The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push the target 1 meter away or cause it to have the Prone condition.The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.

  Note: Unarmed strikes and natural weapons are not considered one-handed or two-handed weapons, and do not have weapon properties, and thus cannot be used with features or abilities that require those items. This includes two-weapon fighting, and many feats that provide bonuses to weapon attacks such as the Great Weapon Master, Polearm Master, and many others.
