  "benefit": "Provides facilities useful for experimenting with and creating new spells. Casters who spend 8 hours in the laboratory can switch one cantrip they know for another cantrip on their classes spell list. Wizards and Factotums can spend 8 hours + 8 hours for each level of the spell to add a new spell to their spellbook without having a scroll for that spell, provided the spell is of a level they can cast and is on their spell list. They must still expend the material cost of scribing the spell to their spell book.",
