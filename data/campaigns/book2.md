# Desperate Measures - Epic of Elthelas Book 4

**Gerasalim is in Flames**. The Fortress of Light has fallen, Strovenguard is an occupied city, Eastguard has been reduced to rubble, and Northport is under imminent threat.  The last of the Gerasaline armies have retreated to the Sword Mountains, attacking the orc armies from caves and hidden strong points. 

**The Moon Elves are nearly extinct**.  After 2 years of being hunted in their homeland their numbers have been reduced to a few thousand refugees who have fled into Eldoran, Curinor, and Gerasalim.

**The Dwarves have retreated to their holds**.  No major hold has ever fallen to a foreign invader, and the Dwarves have withdrawn their armies to wait out the crisis.

**Eldoran is in civil war**.  The sudden extinction of the royal line and the ascension of the relatively incompetent Derandel to the throne left a massive power vacuum that various local lords have risen to fill.  Only the Waelin region on continental Elathia still fights against the Orcs, now desperate for reinforcements as Orc armies march directly on their borders.

**Dormania has withdrawn from the Alliance**. The ascension of Aladon Maristos to the Imperial Throne as Dorman XXIII led quickly to a peace treaty between Dormania and Malinval, meanwhile any who oppose the Emperor’s will suffer violent deaths, and the Emperor has promised to reclaim Kandor for the empire.

**Kandor fights invasion from 2 sides**.  The Orcs are now on the unfortified southern border of Kandor, sending raids north while they attempt to deal with the remaining Gerasaline armies, meanwhile the Dormanian legions threaten invasion from the East.

**Into this destruction Gerad Heartbren, last commander of the Black Wolf Irregulars, has put out one last desperate call for recruitment**.  You have answered this call, for reasons of your own, and have travelled to the fortress of Cur’Estan in the woods of Kandor, where the he is gathering the forces that will make a last desperate stand against evil in Elathia.

## Cur'Estan

Cur'Estan was once the fortress capitol of an ancient minor Kandori king, destroyed by Dorman I and left as a ruin in the woods.  20 years ago the Black Wolf Irregulars rebuilt the central castle to serve as their headquarters, and over the twenty years since a small town has sprung up around the castle serving the needs of the castle.  Over the last year, as the orcs have ravaged Demal'Thor, and then moved into Gerasalim, refugees have slowly trickled into the town.  A refugee camp has sprung up on the outskirts, now threatening to outnumber the original residents.

The de facto ruler of Cur'Estan is General Gerad Heartbren of the Black Wolf Irregulars.  He commands the castle, and roughly 2000 soldiers, the last remains of the Black Wolf Irregulars forces.
