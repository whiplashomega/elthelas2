# The Crystal of Light - Epic of Elthelas Book 1

The Crystal of Light is the first of a series of campaigns in historical order, set more or less 1 right after the other with different groups of heroes.  The Crystal of Light details how everything went wrong, and the lives of the heroes caught up in it.  Later books refer to several of the 'standard' heroes listed here.  If you play through several campaigns with the same group you can replace the standard heroes with the heroes of your players in the later campaigns to provide a check-in as to the continuation of the world, and the fate of their players.  Any of the standard heroes that don't have a decent analog among the players can be presented as friendly NPCs who aid the players through the campaign.
