  "history": "Gorgro featured prominently in the development of nearby nations, as many of the creatures that call the high plateau home are difficult to deal with, to say the least. Tribes of giants and trolls can eat entire villages before men can be marshaled to defense, and Ogres, Trollkin, Gnolls, and Hobgoblins are certainly not threats to sneeze at. However, no one has ever really recorded any history of the denizens of the plateau itself.",
