  "description": "Baalzebul, Lord of Lies, Duke of the Seventh Layer of Hell, is commonly worshipped among goblinoids, particularly bugbears.  He takes the appearance of a massive slug, with tiny half-formed arms and eye stalks that move independently, watching all around him.  Baalzebul originally was a Solar in the service of Cora, who zealously took his war to the nine hells, arrogantly believing he could best Asmodeous himself, before falling to it's corrupting influence.  His arrogance remained even after his first transformation to a devil, and he betrayed Asmodeous soon after rising to rule his layer of Hell.  Asmodeous transformed him into his current appearance as a punishment, although he did not strip him of his rank for reasons unknown."
