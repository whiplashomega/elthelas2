  "description": "Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, was killed by Demigorgon long ago, before rising again as an undead demon lord.  He reclaimed his realm of Thanatos and now continues his endless war with his two rivals, Demigorgon and Graz'zt.  Orcus bears an unconditional hatred for all things, living and dead.  He takes a special pleasure in causing havoc on the material plane, attracting worshippers with the promise of power, and then discarding them once he grows bored of them."
