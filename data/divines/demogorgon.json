  "description": "Demogorgon, Prince of Demons, rules in the Gaping Maw.  His home is a realm of dark seas and fetid swamps, populated by sea monsters of all kinds.  Demogorgon rules by sheer strength, as there are few who could possibly face him directly in battle, even among the other demon lords, and win.  His largest rivals in the abyss are Orcus and Graz'zt.  Demogorgon himself is a massive behemoth, with 2 heads and ape-like arms."
