  "description": "Mephistopheles, Lord of Ambition, Duke of the Eighth Layer of Hell, constantly covets Asmodeous throne.  He believes he is the rightful ruler of the Nine Hells.  However, his own unpredictable behavior has alienated the other Dukes, and left him without sufficient power to unseat Asmodeous.  Nevertheless he constantly schemes to undermine Asmodeous.  Why Asmodeous hasn't cast Mephistopheles down, as he did other Archdevils who rebelled against him, is one of the great mysteries of the Nine Hells.  Perhaps it is because his hate for Asmodeous is only matched by his hate for Baalzebul, and thus Asmodeous can play the two Dukes against each other, securing his own position with little true effort."
