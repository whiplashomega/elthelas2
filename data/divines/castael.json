  "description": "Castael, the watcher, is a servant of Nera, and is responsible for enforcing the Gods Agreement, his sword is rumored to be able to slay even a God. Legend has it that Castael has died many times to many challengers, but he is always reborn. Certain apocryphal legends state that Castael is actually the name of a position, rather than one being, and whoever takes up the Sword of Castael is cursed to enforce the will of Nera over the other Gods."
