  "description": "Known as the Avatar of Chaos, Bartholomew often appears as a little child. A 'servant' of the Chaos Gods--Malik, Molton, and Cora--he is tasked with disrupting the lawful order of the world (his 'servant' status is more a technicality than anything, tales tell that he rarely follows the expressed wishes of these Gods either, they have simply taken responsibility for him among the pantheon, protecting him from more severe retribution). He is involved with everything from starting rebellions to unpredictable natural disasters such as earthquakes. He is often reviled by the leaders of the more law-bent churches, such as those worshipping Alohim, Bahamut, Dorman, or even Mat'raktha, as many tales tell of how he has dashed the well laid plans of these Gods quests for order through power.\n\nA common way to curse someone is to give them the sign of Bartholomew, a drawing combining the holy symbols of the 3 Gods he serves, a banner all but consumed in flames over a compass rose of arrows."
