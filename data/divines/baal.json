  "description": "The Master of the Abyss, Greatest of Demons, Ba'al. Ba'al is not truly the leader of the abyss, it is hard to rule a land of pure chaos and evil, but he is the closest there is to a single leader, in that no other Demon dares to challenge him. While technically a party to the Gods Agreement, Ba'al routinely ignores it, sending demons into the Material Plane whenever the opportunity presents itself. This has led to several major cataclysmic events on Elthelas, some recorded in history, and others not."
