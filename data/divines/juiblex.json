  "description": "Juibex, the Faceless Lord, Lord of Corrosion and Decay, is a massive demon made of jelly and slime.  He has no particular goals, and is content to simply exist, as his existence alone perpetuates decay in everything around him.  His home in the Abyss, the slime pits, is populated by oozes and jelly's.  Few true demons pay him homage, but similarly none have been able to remove him from power in his home."
