  "description": "Cithos, Lord of Madness, lies in the darkest hidden reaches of the mind. He represents a huge untapped reservoir of divine and arcane energy, one that very few dare to seek out. Those that do often find themselves plagued with otherworldly nightmares, losing time and control over themselves as Cithos essence leaks into their souls, tainting them. The final result is always the same, death, usually self-inflicted. Cithos is believed to be a servant of Fa'atasi."
