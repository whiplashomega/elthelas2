  "description": "The arch-devil, Lord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus was a major player in the Gods War, allying himself with Mat'raktha and Malik. Since the Gods War, Asmodeus has never again taken such an aggressive stance towards the world, his lawful nature forcing him to be bound to the agreement he made at the end of the war. Instead he seeks to gain souls and influence for his kingdom by making deals with other beings. He has been known to intervene more directly, however, when others break their agreements with him, and he does little to reign in the other Dukes of Hell."
