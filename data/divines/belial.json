  "description": "Belial, Lord of Rape, Deposed Lord of the Fourth Layer of Hell, still maintains the power of a Duke of Hell, having willingly stepped down from his post in favor of his daughter Fierna.  Belial still has the authority of command over those in his daughters realm.  Belial has an insatiable lust, and often forces himself on captives, slaves, or even other devils.  He has produced countless progeny this way, who then spread his will across the planes."
