  "description": "Also called the Angel of Death, Azrael is a servant of Nera, often representing her darker aspect, but nevertheless maintaining her neutral stance in the world. He is the enforcer who prevents immortality. Legend has it that Dorman I challenged Azrael to single combat, and gained immortality, and later godhood, by defeating him."
