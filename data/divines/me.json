  "description": "'Me' is a 'planar' being, not to be differentiated from an 'extra-planar' being, but really from beings who are of planes at all. 'Me' could probably best be described as a sentient living plane (or potentially demi-plane) of existence. The existence of 'Me' is only known about due to a few magical accidents in which wizards of one sort or another found themselves on the plane of 'Me'. It isn't in fact clear if there is just one such plane, or if perhaps there are many. The name 'Me' stems mostly, it seems, from not having a name, or really understanding the concept of names, while still having an individual identity. The plane, when asked who it is, has been known to express confusion and repeat the statement, \"I am me.\"\n\nThe being was recently revealed to be a broken aspect of the trapped Goddess Area.  She briefly returned to the world only to be slain by the dagger of Nera, famed to be able to kill even a God.  Rumors that the demiplane she was entrapped upon still exists, and still bears the mark of her consciousness are so far unproven."
