  "description": "Mammon, Duke of Greed, Lord of the Third Layer of Hell, is a power hungry schemer who loves wealth and gold.  He appears as a massive serpentlike creature, similar to a Naga, with horns and a forked tongue.  He is quicker to betray his allies than other devils, should he see it to be in his advantage to do so, causing him to be distrusted be other devils.  He is the only Duke of Hell who accepts gold in return for services in addition to souls."
