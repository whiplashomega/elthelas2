**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 6m

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Strength

**Save For**: avoid the spell or damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "2d6", label: "bludgeoning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

You choose a 1m-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 1m of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spellâ€™s duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.
