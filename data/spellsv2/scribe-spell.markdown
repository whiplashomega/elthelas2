Channeling magic through quill and ink, you scribe an Arcane spell in your spellbook or a blank book. The scribed spell must be of a level which you can prepare, and the book must lack the spell.

As you magically scribe the spell, you must copy it from another spellbook or a Spell Scroll, or you must have it prepared. If you copy it from a Spell Scroll, the scroll is destroyed. If you have the spell prepared, the casting time and component costs are halfed. Certain class features may also reduce this cost.

When the scribing is complete, the spell becomes one of your known spells in the book, appearing on its own page if the book was out of pages. The spell appears in a cipher that is understandable only to you or someone casting Identify or Scribe Spell, and if the book was blank before the scribing, that book is now your spellbook.
