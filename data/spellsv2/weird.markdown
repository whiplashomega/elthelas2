Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 6m-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. Until the spell ends at the start of each of the frightened creature's turns it must make a wisdom saving throw or take 6d10 psychic damage.
