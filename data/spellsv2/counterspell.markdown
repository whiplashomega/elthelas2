**3rd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 12m of you casting a spell.

**Range**: 12m

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

You attempt to interrupt a creature that you can see in the process of casting a spell. Invisible creatures or spells cast without verbal or somatic components cannot be targeted.

You are able to determine the level of the spell and the nature of the spell before you decide to cast Counterspell.

Creatures that use innate spellcasting abilities or items that replicate spell effects (like the Necklace of Fireballs) cannot be targeted with Counterspell. Creatures that use items to cast a spell (like the Staff of Power) can be targeted with Counterspell.

Make an ability check using your spellcasting modifier.

The DC equals 6 + 2 * the spell level.

On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect. The spell slot is lost.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast the spell as a 4th level spell or higher add 1 to your ability modifier for each level above 3rd.
