You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 2m of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 6m to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die
