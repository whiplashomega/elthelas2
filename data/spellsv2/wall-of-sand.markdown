You conjure up a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 9m long, 3m high, and 3m thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of sight but not movement. A creature is blinded while in the wallâ€™s space and must spend 2m of movement for every 1m it moves there.
