You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause. trees, rocks, and grasses
in a 18m cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.

**Grasses and Undergrowth.** Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.

**Trees.** At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 3m of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing
damage from whipping branches.

**Roots and Vines.** At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become
restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on
a success.

**Rocks.** As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.
