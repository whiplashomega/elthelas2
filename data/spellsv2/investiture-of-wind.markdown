Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits:

* Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
* You gain a flying speed of 18m. If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.
* You can use your action to create a 4m cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 12m of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 3m away from the center of the cube.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die
