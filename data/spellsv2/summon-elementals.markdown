**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 18m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: [ ]

You call forth an elemental servant that appears in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears, based on the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell. Your DM may approve additional options.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
