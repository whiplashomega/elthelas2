**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "4d8", "label": "lightning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" }, { "dice": "2d8", "label": "lightning within 10 ft", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell’s duration, the weapon’s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it’s a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 5d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon’s normal damage.

Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 3m of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 3d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die
