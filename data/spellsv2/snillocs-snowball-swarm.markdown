**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 27m

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of ice or a small white rock chip)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "3d6", "label": "cold", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "1d6" } ]

A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 3m-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die
