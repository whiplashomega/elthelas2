**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 12m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon’s type, selecting from the list below depending on the level at which you cast the spell. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.

At the end of each of the demons turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non—demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, the demon becomes uncontrolled and hostile to you but remains for the duration.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood of a humanoid killed within the last 24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can’t cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it.
