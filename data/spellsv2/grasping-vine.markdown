**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: 9m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: not pulled

**Damage**: []

You conjure a vine that sprouts from the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. When you cast this spell, you can direct the vine to lash out at a creature within 9m of it that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the vine and pulled 6m directly toward the vine. If the spell targets a different creature the grappled condition ends on the first creature.

Until the spell ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the same creature or another one as a bonus action on each of your turns.
