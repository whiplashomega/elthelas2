**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell you can eat any number of these berries, or feed them to a creature you can touch. Berries remaining after that can be consumed in any number at a time using the rules for consuming potions. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and eating all 10 berries provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for a day.

The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.
