**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

A 3m-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside. Sound can pass into the dome but does not pass out.
