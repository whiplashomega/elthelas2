**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "1d4", label: "radiant", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

Holy power radiates from you in an aura with a 6m radius, awakening boldness in friendly creatures. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. While in the aura, each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage when it hits with a weapon attack.

**At Higher Levels** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the damage by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
