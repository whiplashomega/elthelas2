You summon abberations that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears, based on the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell. Your DM may approve additional options.

The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns.
