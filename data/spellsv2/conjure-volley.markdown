**5th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 45m

**Components**: V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or one throwing weapon)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "8d8", label: "piercing", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 8m-radius, 6m-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.
