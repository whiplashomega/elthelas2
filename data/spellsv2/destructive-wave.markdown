**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (9m radius)

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: half damage and not knocked prone

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "5d6", label: "thunder", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" }, { "dice": "5d6", label: "radiant or necrotic", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" }  ]

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 9m of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
