**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 34m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "3d10", label: "lightning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "1d10" } ]

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 2m tall with a 12m radius, centered on a point you can see 20m directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 2m of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
