**4th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 36m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: no effect

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "4d10", label: "radiant", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 9m-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take
4d10 radiant damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 1m radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit
from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
