**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 12m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: no damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "1d6", "label": "cold", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
