**4th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexerity

**Save For**: half damage and no secondary damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "10d4", "label": "initial acid", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "2d4" }, { "dice": "5d4", "label": "end of turn acid", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

You point at a place within range, and a glowing 1-foot ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.
