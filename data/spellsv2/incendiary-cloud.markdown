**8th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 45m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "10d8", "label": "fire", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 6m-range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 3m directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.
