**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 18m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Strength

**Save For**: not restrained

**Damage**: []

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 4m square starting form a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
