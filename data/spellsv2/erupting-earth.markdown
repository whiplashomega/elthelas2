**3rd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 24m

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of obsidian)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "3d12", label: "bludgeoning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 6m cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared away. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die
