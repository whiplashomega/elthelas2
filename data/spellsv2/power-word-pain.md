**7th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 18m

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: end the spell

**Damage**: []

You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. The target is subject
to crippling pain. A target is unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 3m. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails
and the spell is wasted.

A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.
