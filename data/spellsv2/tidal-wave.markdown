**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 36m

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of water)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage, not knocked prone

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "4d8", "label": "bludgeoning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 9m long, up to 6m wide, and up to 3m tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 9m of it.
