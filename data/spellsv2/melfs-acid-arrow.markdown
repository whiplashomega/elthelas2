**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "4d6", "label": "acid", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } , { "dice": "2d6", "label": "second turn acid", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" }]

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 acid damage immediately and 2d6 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die size
