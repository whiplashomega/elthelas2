**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 18m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: [ ]

You summon fey spirits that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears, based on the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell. Your DM may approve additional options.

The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the fey creature doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled fey creature can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
