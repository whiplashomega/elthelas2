**3rd-level illusion (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 9m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creatureâ€™s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 2m away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 30m and can travel 15 km in an hour, or 20 km at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
