**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30m line)

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "8d6", "label": "lightning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "1d6" } ]

A stroke of lightning forming a line 20m long and 1m wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
