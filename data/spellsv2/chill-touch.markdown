**Necromancy cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 24m

**Duration**: 1 round

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "1d10", label: "necrotic", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "1d10" } ]

You channel the chill of the grave toward one creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit the target takes 1d10 Necrotic damage, and it can't regain Hit Points until the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).
