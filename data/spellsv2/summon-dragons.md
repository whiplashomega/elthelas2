**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 18m

**Components**: V, S, M (an object with the image of a dragon engraved on it, worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

You call forth a dragon that appears in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears, based on the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell. Your DM may approve additional options.

The dragon is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the dragon, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the dragon doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the dragon, they become hostile toward you and your companions, and they might attack. An uncontrolled dragon can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
