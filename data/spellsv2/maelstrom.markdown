**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 36m

**Components**: V, S, M (paper or leaf in the shape of a funnel)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Strength

**Save For**: no effect

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "6d6", "label": "bludgeoning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

A mass of 1m-deep water appears and swirls in a 9m radius centered on a point you can see within range. The point must be on ground or in a body of water. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 3m toward the center.
