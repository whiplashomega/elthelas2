**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of water)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 9m long, 2m high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 6m in diameter  6m high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 1m square section is frozen). Each 1m-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it.
