**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 34m

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Constitution

**Save For**: half damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "2d8", label: "random", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" },  { "dice": "1d6", label: "random", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "1d6" }  ]

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 2d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attacks damage type, as shown below.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>D8</th><th>Damage Type</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Acid</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Cold</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Fire</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Force</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>Lightning</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>Poison</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>Psychic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>Thunder</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1d6
