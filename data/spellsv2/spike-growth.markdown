**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 45m

**Components**: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: []

The ground in a 4m radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 1m it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
