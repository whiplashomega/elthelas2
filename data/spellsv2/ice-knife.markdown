**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 18m

**Components**: S, M (a drop of water or piece of ice)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: no cold damage

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "1d10", "label": "piercing", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" },  { "dice": "2d6", "label": "cold", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" }  ]

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 2m of the point where the ice exploded must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

**Playtest Note** Damage increased by 1 die
