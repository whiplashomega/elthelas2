The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 6m-radius, 8m-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This
light is sunlight.

When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.

If youâ€™re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.
