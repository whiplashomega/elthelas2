**Saving Throw**:

**Save For**:

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "1d6", label: "fire", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 6m and moving doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 1m of a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 1m for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.
