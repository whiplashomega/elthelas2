**4th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 27m

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Saving Throw**: Dexterity

**Save For**: no effect

**Damage**: [ { "dice": "3d6", label: "bludgeoning", "damagebonus": 0, "addstat": false, "prof": false, "higherlevels": "" } ]

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 6m square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
