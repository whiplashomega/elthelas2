The thunder can be heard from up to 90m away.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesnâ€™t exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 1m of you when you cast this spell, and there must be an unoccupied space within 1m of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.
