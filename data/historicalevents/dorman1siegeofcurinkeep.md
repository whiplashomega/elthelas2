Dorman I Conquers Sreppe and Kandor
After conquering southern Dormania it took Dorman a few years to successfully digest his conquests up to that point.  He destroyed remnants of the old regimes, destroyed records, and generally crushed any remnants of the previous cultures that were not useful to him.  Once he felt secure in his powerbase in the east, he began to move west.

The kingdoms and city states west of the Dormanian Heartland were not blind to Dorman's ambitions, and sought allies to the south in the form of the Gerasaline alliance, a preexisting alliance of martial city states and small kingdoms that maintained a mutual defense treaty in the face of continual orcish aggression.  However, Dorman got to them first.  Dorman promised the alliance that he would leave them alone, and, once he had conquered the northern territories, that he would send his best legions to help them secure the border.  They agreed, and the farming communities of Western Dormania and Kandor found themselves outnumbered and outmaneuvered.  In another two year war, Dorman swept through the Kandori plains and began the process of integrating them into his empire.
