Dorman I Unites the Imperial 'Heartland'
When Dorman I became King of Desadorel it was one of a cluster of human city states in Northeast Elathia that all shared similar cultural practices.  After spending a couple of years consolidating his power in Desadorel and expanding his armies, the depth of his ambition started to show.  First Desadorel's two nearest neighbors, their names now lost to history, were crushed in a lightning-fast war.  He renamed both cities in his own honor (today they are East Dormania and West Dormania) and declared the resulting kingdom the Empire of Dormania, and himself Emperor.  Then in 1388 he declared war on his closest true rival, the city state of Falak.

Falak was the largest city in the area at the time, controlling the trade on the (now named) Dorman River.  Dorman put the city under siege with his main force, before teleporting himself and his 6 best men into the royal palace.  The 7 of them managed to kill the king, his retinue, and their personal guards before carving their way to the city gates and openning them for the besieging army. The next two cities he besieged surrendered without a fight, the Unification Wars, and Dorman I quest to rule the world had officially begun.
