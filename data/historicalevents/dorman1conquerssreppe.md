Dorman I Sieges Curin Keep
In 1400 YFC, after successfully subdueing the Kandori, Dorman's next target was the vassal kingdoms of Curinor in the hills on the western edge of Kandor.  Populated by a mix of dwarves and humans, and not technically subject to the Dwarves, Dorman was convinced his reputation would keep the Dwarves from intervening because they would not want to try to fight him given that he was not threatening them directly.  This was probably the greatest strategic miscalculation Dorman ever made.

While Dorman had no trouble conquering the vassal states, Curinor immediately declared war and mustered large armies to push back against Dorman.  The initial fighting was bloody, but Dorman managed to continue his string of victories, but he couldn't pin down the dwarves, who strategically retreated to their holds every time he thought he had them. Frustrated with his inability to beat the dwarves decisively, Dorman marched on their capitol, Curin Keep, and in the summer of 1401, laid siege.

The siege would last for 7 years, with Dorman's armies constantly harried by Dwarven units, and Curin Keep never showing signs of starvation or struggle.  Even in 1401, the great tunnels connecting the holds was a closely guarded secret, and one that meant Dorman could never starve out the Dwarves of Curin Keep.  He attempted assaults three times, but the stiff Dwarven fortifications and their skill at tunnel fighting and tactics meant Dorman was forced to retreat each time after taking heavy casualties.  Finally in 1408 Dorman gave up, and signed a peace treaty with the dwarves.  The old vassal kingdoms were split, half becoming permanently part of Curinor, and the other half becoming part of Dormania.
