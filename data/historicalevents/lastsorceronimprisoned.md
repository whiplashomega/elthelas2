Last Sorceron Imprisoned
After the Gods War, a few surviving isolated Sorceron still wandered Elthelas.  Most were of little note, bred into the local population (creating today's Sorceron Blooded) and eventually died in some disease or war.  However, there was one notable exception.

His name is lost to history, but his story is not.  The people of Zelfir refer to him as the Enchanter.  The Enchanter had been a powerful servant of Asmodeous during the war, and was incredibly skilled in magic, particularly enchanting.  Soon after the war he found himself in a small human village, the first of the Hisru people.  Missing his former luxury, he used his magic to enslave the villagers, a practice he continued for generations.  As the population grew and they were continually subjected to enchantment, the Hisru people gained an increasing resistance to enchantment, and eventually a group of them that were able to resist his control came together in secret.

Unable to free their people by force, these resisters pled with the Goddess Amathera to grant them the ability to protect their people from further oppression.  Amathera heard their pleas, and taught them the ways of magic.  She also granted them two powerful artifacts that could create impenetrable barriers of pure force.  Using the magic Amathera had taught them, they dispelled the Enchanter's magic and disabled him.  They transported him far from their people, and then imprisoned him using Amathera's artifact.

It was then that they named themselves the Hisru, or the protected.
