927






Alfadir Colonized
Staelia, since its founding, was an oppressive regime, with high taxes, mandatory military service, and strict laws.  By the 9th century many merchants had begun to resent this fact, dreaming of a merchant republic similar to that of the Morrind.  Eventually these merchants came together and formed a plan that they proposed to the king, they would leave Staelia to build colonies elsewhere, and in return they would sell whatever goods they produced exclusively to Staelia.

The king accepted their proposal, and the merchants left in 927, building towns in the largely empty southern territories of Hisru'de'tan.  They soon found that the King of Staelia had no way to enforce the bargain they had made with him however.  Trade with Zelfir, Hisru'de'tan, and Stagenheim was much more profitable than with martial-minded Staelia, and Staelia was too busy in its own never-ending war with the trolls and giants to try to enforce rules in its wayward colony.
