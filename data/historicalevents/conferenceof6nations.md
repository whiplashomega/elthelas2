Conference of the 6 Nations of Northern Elathia
The 6th Mithril War, and the amazing success of the dwarf, human, and moon elf alliance gave the Queen of Gerasalim an idea.  For years, the moon elves of Demal Thor, the dwarves of Curinor, and the humans of Gerasalim had fought off the orcs without coordination and with great difficulty.  Meanwhile the attacking orc armies had begun to grow in size and coordination.

She called the 5 nations back together, as well as inviting the young king of the very nation they had fought against, Eldoran, who had inherited the throne just the year before.  When the representatives arrived it was the first time the rulers of all of the good aligned nations on the mainland of Elathia had met together.  The decision of the council was simple and profound: the nations worshipping the good-aligned gods should no longer fight each other, but fight together against their common enemies.  It spawned a series of additional dicussions among diplomats from all 6 nations, eventually creating a new inter-governmental organization: the Alliance of 6 Nations, dedicated to the defence of the southern borders and the containment of the Orcs.
