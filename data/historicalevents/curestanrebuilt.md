Cur'Estan Rebuilt
The Black Wolf Irregulars, still a young organization, had been growing enough as of 1832 to need a true headquarters.  After performing several favors for the King of Kandor, the ruins of Cur'Estan were granted to them so long as they rebuilt it.  The project took 3 long years, bringing in hundreds of workers, spending massive amounts of resources.
