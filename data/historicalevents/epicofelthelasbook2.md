Epic of Elthelas Book 2: The Rise of Gods
In the late spring of 1844, a group of adventurers came together in a small town in southern Gerasalim to deal with some unusual troubles it was having.  It soon became clear that the toubles the town was having were being caused by a particular troublesome bard, by the name of Galen.  Galen had been presumed dead after falling from an exploding airship in Morrindim.  They followed him across the south, encountering another of the adventurers from Book 1, Jim Jimmy Jim Jim, the already crazed gnomish wizard, now driven insane by the crystal keeping 'Me' imprisoned.  He passed the crystal to this new group of adventurers, charging the half-dwarf Ralf with its protection.

The adventurers pursued Galen to Aridhem, where they worked with the Alliance General there to infiltrate the city.  Once there, Dench Stormclaw, last survivor of the Stormclaw clan that had previously ruled Morda'serek'hai, instigated a rebellion with the aid of his old vassals.  They followed Galen into a group of caves beneath the city, where they followed him into a teleportation portal that led to the Mountain of Fang in the desert of Nerim.

After escaping the desert, they pursued Galen to orcish territory, where they encountered invading demons, and continued following him to Degak'Ta, and then to Marinda.  There the hero Rhakheim, Paladin of Dorman, closed the demon gate and together they faced Galen, finally killing him, only to have Ralf be mind controlled by the creature within the crystal.

They travelled back into orcish territory, retreiving Nera's god-killing dagger from the ruins of Peloria, and faced the now freed creature known as 'Me', who with its memory restored, declared that she was the long imprisoned Goddess Area, Queen of Rebirth and Retribution, and declared her intent to take her revenge on the goddess of Death herself, Nera, an act that would surely restart the Gods War.

Taking aid from the Earth Goddess Gaian, the adventurers travelled to Nerim's Palace, at the conflux of the positive and negative energy planes, and fighting throw Area's servants, returned Nera's dagger to her.  Nera struck down Area, and the released divine energy turned the adventurers present into Angelic beings, now direct servants of their Gods.  All except the aethiest Trollkin Fighter and mercenary, Butch, who returned to Elthelas.
