Kingdom of Staelia Formed
Staelia sits in a brutal position.  The weather is harsh and unforgiving, meanwhile large populations of giants, trolls, and unspeakable creatures regularly sweep down from the Gorgro plateau to raid, pillage, and steal.  The human population of Staelia survived for their first 1000 years by attempting to avoid fighting the invaders whenever possible.  They built escape holes, hid in nearby caves, or fled into the forests when the evil creatures approached.  The 6th century, however, brought change for Staelia.  A small group of champions, incredibly skilled in combat, came together and determined to protect the people of Staelia, and end the threat that the trolls and giants posed.  They left one of their number behind in Staelia to help the people protect themselves, while the rest of them would venture into the Gorgro plateau itself to find the giants home and destroy them.

The expedition must have met with some success, as raids on Staelia stopped for several years, but the adventurers never returned.  The one who stayed behind did not shirk his duty however.  With the people of Staelia behind him, he trained soldiers, built fortifications and roads, and organized tournaments of martial skill.  All of this required a massive amount of effort and money, as well as centralization of power.  By the time it was clear his companions would never return, he was king in all but name, a fact that would change in 523, when the council of nobles (unsurprisingly, most of whom had been appointed by him) elected him and his heirs Kings of Staelia for all eternity.
