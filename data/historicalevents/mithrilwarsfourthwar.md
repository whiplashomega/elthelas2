The Fourth Mithril War
The drawing of an official border at the end of the Third War did not end the mistrust and rivalry between elves and dwarves concerning the Mithril Hills.  Both sides were determined to fully enforce their claims, and the first major settlement efforts of the hills took form, surrounded by a massive fortification effort.  Huge fortresses soon covered both sides of the border.  

This was the state of things when in 1345 a company of elven adventurers arrived in the Mithril Hills, doing odd jobs for various elven patrons in the area.  Eventually they took a job from an avidly anti-dwarf landowner, who claimed a group of dwarves had crossed the border and stolen an important family heirloom from him.  The adventurers crossed into dwarf territory, pressed the landowners accusations, murdered 15 dwarven miners, and made off with several works of priceless art and several hundred pounds of mithril bullion. The local elven governor, having been helped by the adventurers in question in the past, refused to turn them over to the dwarven authorities for prosecution, and things quickly spiraled out of control.

The war itself was largely a standoff between the opposing fortresses.  The elves sent several armies to the area, as did the dwarves.  The elves relied on attempts to prevent the resupply of the dwarf fortresses, while the dwarves generally preferred direct assault.  In the end, a cease fire was declared and the old border remained in force, but only because a northward push by the orcs that had begun some 15 years earlier was becoming impossible to contain while also warring over the Mithril Hills.
