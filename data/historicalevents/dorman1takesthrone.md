Dorman I Becomes King of Desadorel
Desadorel, before it became capitol of an empire, was a small city state that relied on mining for most of its wealth.  In 1363 a local miner had a son who named Dorman.  Dorman grew up in the mines before enlisting in the military at 16.  His gift for fighting was recognized early, and by the age of 18 he had risen to Captain of the City Guard, then the next year he was made a personal advisor to the King, then when in 1384 the King died suddenly of a heart attack.  He had a 3 year old heir, but Dorman convincingly made the argument that the city needed stability and strength, and with the backing of most of the cities wealthy merchants and the army he killed the kings heir and several supporters of his in the court before being crowned King of Desadorel by the local priest of Alohim.
