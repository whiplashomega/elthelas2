Epic of Elthelas Book 1: The Crystal of Light
1843 saw the fighting on the border become increasingly intense.  The orcs began working in concert, sending larger armies on coordinated strategic attacks and raids.  The Alliance began recruiting heavily to attempt to counter what they assumed was the rise of a new Orc Warlord.  Then the Crystal of Light, hanging over the Fortress of Light, disappeared in the night.  A group of new recruits was blamed and imprisoned, but quickly escaped.  

The escaped recruits proved to be capable adventurers, chasing the true thieves across Malinval.  They were there when a demonic gate openned in the Morrind city Marinda.  They finally caught the thieves as they attempted to rob the Mages Guild of Morrindim.  The thieves, a group of Stagen Gnome rogues, refused to give up the crystal, blowing up their airship, and the crystal.  The corpse of one of the recruits was then stolen by a strange and incredibly powerful extraplanar being calling itself 'Me'.

This being was pursued by the remaining adventurers to the shores of Gnarra, where they barely stopped it from taking control of the Goddess Gaian.  Gaian awoke, and she and Amathera aided the adventurers in pursuing and defeating the being.
