Black Shard Pass Constructed
When Dorman I finished conquering the human kingdoms in the north, he wanted to move south into the orc kingdoms. In order to provide an additional route of attack for his armies, he set his best engineers and mages to building a traversable pass through the largely impassable mountains. They chose a likely spot, and literally set about destroying a mountain to create a low pass. They succeeded (as did Dorman's advance), but they discovered that the heart of the mountain had been made of almost pure obsidian.
