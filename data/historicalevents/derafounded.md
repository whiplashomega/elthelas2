Nation of Dera Founded
Dera was the first true human nation on Elthelas, forming from a collection of city-states in northern Riftlan.  The wilds of Riftlan even then presented a unique challenge that cooperation and sharing of resources reduced greatly.  Rather than any of the city-states take presedence over the others, they decided to build a new capitol, the city of Dera.
