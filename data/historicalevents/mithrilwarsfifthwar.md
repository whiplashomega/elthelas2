The Fifth Mithril War
The cause of the fifth mithril war is hard to pin down.  The elves blamed the dwarves, claiming they tunneled into elven territory, the dwarves claimed the elves purposefully collapsed the tunnels of a legally built dwarven hold.  Nevertheless, the fifth mithril war was the hottest and most bloody mithril war since the first, and was most definitely the longest.

Atrocities quickly piled up on both sides, and the war continued until late 1523, when an Elven prince (and Champion of Cora) brokered a peace treaty so that the armies of both nations could turn their focus to the escalating Nerim Cataclysm.
