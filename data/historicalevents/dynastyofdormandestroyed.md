Dorman XXII and His Heirs are Murdered 
Dorman XXII had not been a particularly skilled Emperor, and dissent in the empire had been great, particularly outside of the heartland.  Then on the 17th of Sylvanus, 1844, he mysteriously fell from the highest window of his tallest tower.  Within hours, his infant son and heir was found suffocated in his bed.  The Empire was left without a ruler for the first time since its founding.
