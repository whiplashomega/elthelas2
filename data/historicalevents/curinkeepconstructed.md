Curin Keep Construction
construction begins on Curin Keep.
The dwarves found themselves fragmented and surrounded by enemies at the end of the God's War, with most groups being killed off relatively early.  One of the major groups that survived was led by a dwarf named Curin Highhammer.  It was about 15 years after the end of the war that Curin proposed an end to searching for their kin, and that the dwarves put down roots and build a proper hold and temple to Dorun, where they could seek the aid of their patron God.  Legend has it that as he made the pronouncement, he struck the ground with his pick, and the rock face in front of him fell away revealing a massive vein of pure gold, and in that spot the dwarves began the delvings that would become known as Curin Keep.
