773






First Border Skirmishes of the Mithril Wars
In 773 the elves founded a small village in the hills on the far western edge of the plains of Curinor.  This act would change history and relations between elves and dwarves forever.

The forested hills, known as the Mithril Hills because of the deposits of that extremely valuable mineral found there, had been claimed by Curinor for generations, but because of its distance from the mountains they had never settled them outside of a couple of small mining holds.  When the dwarves discovered the elven village in what they considered dwarven territory, they arrested all of the villagers for illegal settlement and burned the village to the ground.

Meanwhile Eldoran, seeing the hills mostly uninhabited, considered it unclaimed territory, and warned the dwarves not to interfere with elven settlement plans, and sent armies with the next group of settlers to secure the territory.  The dwarves sent their own armies and additional settlers to contest the elven claim, and the first skirmishes followed shortly therafter.
