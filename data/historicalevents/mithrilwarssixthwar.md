Mithril Wars Sixth War
In 1774 A dispute between Curinor and Kandor over a half-dwarf hold on the border escalated into open war.  The dwarves were hard pressed but winning, and were forced to call their garrisons from the Mithril Hills to the east to reinforce their armies.  The elves saw it as an opportunity to take revenge on the dwarves for siding with the Moon Elves and take control of the Mithril Hills for good.  They sent elf armies into the largely undefended hills and slaughtered every dwarf they could find.  It was a genocide on par with that of the dwarves march through Eldoran in the First Mithril War.  The dwarves quickly concluded a peace with Kandor, giving up the half-dwarf hold in return for help against the elves, sent their armies back to the Hills, and called on their Moon Elf allies.  They also sent representatives to the other ex-imperial nations, Gerasalim and Dormania, who quickly marshalled forces to help.

The genocide by the elves turned half the continent against them, and the elves armies were quickly beaten by the combined forces of 5 opposing nations.  The resulting peace treaty permanently ceded the Mithril Hills to Curinor, but left it as a semi-independent territory with a largely independent elven governor.
