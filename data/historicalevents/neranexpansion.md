Neran Imperial Expansion
The Empire of Nerim started as a cluster of 6 city states with semi-independent kings, all worshippers of Nera, goddess of death and rebirth.  Through a series of political maneuverings, Immanuel Exorsa, a particularly skilled priest of Nerim managed to get himself appointed High Priest of the Church of Nerim in all 6 cities in 950 YFC. He was popular with the people, had the support of the armies, and gave the kings a simple choice, swear unending fealty to him or suffer the wrath of Nera herself.  Indeed everyone in Nerim believed him to be Nera's chosen prophet, who spoke for the Goddess in all things.

With a power base secured, the new Prophet and Emperor immediately began a campaign to turn all of the Neran subcontinent to the worship of Nera, and subservience to him, by force if necessary.  The series of wars that followed eventually led to the complete dominance of the subcontinent outside of the wild forests of the far south by 1250 YFC.  The Prophet of Nera, his life extended far beyond that of any other living mortal outside of Dragonkind, was by now easily the most powerful man on Elthelas.  His empire, while it did not quite equal Eldoran in territory, had triple the population, and quadruple the martial strength.  Even beyond the strength of their living soldiers, powerful necromancers raised and kept armies of undead servants that provided both martial and material support.  Rich landowners would buy wands allowing them to control their own undead servants to work their plantations, mines and factories.  Diseases were tamed, the wilds laid low, and the first sewer systems built in the cities.  The improved living conditions led to a population explosion, and by 1276 colonial territories were sought in order to relieve the pressure.  The Immortal Armies, as the Empires troops were now called, carved out territories in southern Elathia, claiming Terron and the Arad coast for the Empire.

This relentless period of expansion would only be checked by the raising of a new Orc Overlord, briefly uniting the orc tribes in a bloody war of retribution.
