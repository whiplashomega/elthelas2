Alfadir gains independence
Alfadir had been independent in all but name since its colonization, but as the trade around the world increased in the 12th and 13th centuries, Alfadir began having trouble with foreign sales of goods and recognition by foreign governments.  It came to a head in 1235 when Stagenheim, after a border despute, imposed harsh trade sanctions on Staelia. Because Alfadir was still nominally part of Staelia, the gnomes applied the restrictions to them as well.

This caused chaos in the markets of Alfadir, their primary advantage in trade was their navigable rivers that allowed them to transport goods down from the mountains of Stagenheim to the sea more cheaply than anyone else.  The merchant council sent an envoy to Staelia demanding formal independence, and threatening war if it wasn't granted.  The combined threat of rebellion in the west and war with the Stagen gnomes left the king little choice, he granted Alfadir formal independence.
