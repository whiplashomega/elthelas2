Fall of the Fortress of Light and Gerasalim
The War with the Orcs fell apart in the second half of 1845 YFC. While the Alliance of 6 Nations had shown signs of trouble, particularly with the succession crisis in Dormania, and the fall of Aridhem in 1844, things changed drastically in 1845. It started with a new election in Curinor bringing into power a isolationist government. Curinor withdrew from the alliance, vowing to protect their own borders but otherwise stay out of the war. It wasn't long after that that the Fortress of Light fell to the orcs. Then the Dormanian succession crisis turned into civil war, and hope for relief from the East crumbled. Then in response to the dwarves move, the new Elven king Darendel declared that the elves would pull back their armies to protect the Elven heartland on the island of Eldoran proper, even as they made up nearly a third of the soldiers defending the southern border of Gerasalim.

Now outnumbered and demoralized, the armies of Gerasalim and Kandor were forced to retreat over and over, as Eastguard fell first at the beginning of 1846, followed by the capitol, Strovenguard. Finally Northport, the last major Gerasaline city, fell at the end of Sylvanus in 1846, the orcs marching in to an empty city, the residents having fled north into Kandor.
