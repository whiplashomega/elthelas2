1692






Moon Elf Rebellion
For most of history Demal Thor had been a colony of Eldoran, and there were no Moon Elves. The moon elves were a slow adaptation to the open savannah and hostile surroundings of the area. As a colony of Eldoran, Demal Thor was surrounded on 3 sides by enemies. Not only did they guard the only pass between Malinval and Eldoran and the closest location to the Blighted Gap, to the north the dwarves continually invaded as part of the many wars over the Mithril Hills, wars which saw no benefit for the Moon Elves, removed as they were from the object of their cause.

A gathering of the moon elf tribes was called, and in early 1692 they called back all of their warriors from the Mithril Hills and other stations outside of Demal Thor. They set up garrisons at Moon Pass, and north and south of the Griffon Peaks, and sent a delegation to conclude their own peace with the dwarves.

The delegation came back with more than just peace. The dwarves, seeing it as a way to weaken their ancient enemy, agreed to support Demal Thor's independence. Over the course of that year Eldoran sent 2 campaigns to try to take back Demal Thor by force. The first attempted to go through Moon Pass, but was stopped by a combination of moon elf harriers and thick dwarven fortifications that had been set up at the most difficult points of the pass. The second attempt tried to swing arround both sides of the Griffon Peaks. The northern army faced attack by the dwarves, and was forced to retreat. The southern army marched unopposed until it suddenly found itself surrounded. By the end of 1692 Eldoran agreed to officially recognize Demal Thor's independence.
