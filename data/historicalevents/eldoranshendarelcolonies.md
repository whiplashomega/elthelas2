Colonization of Shendarel by Eldoran
The island of Olda had been the domain of Orcs and Goblins since the end of the Gods War.  A fact that had prevented the elves from inhabiting one of their closest neighbors for years. With plenty of easily conquered territory on the mainland, the elves abandoned early efforts to colonize the island. By early in the 8th century they had begun to encounter severe resistance to further expansion into Elathia, and rather than risk all-out-war with the dwarves or humans over what they considered subpar land (or rather, unforested grasslands), they decided it would be more worthwhile to try to push the Orcs out of Olda.  

Armies were dispatched, and the Orcs were quickly pushed to the southern half of the island.  Colonists followed the armies, founding the city of Swava.  The elves called this new territory Shendarel (or 'Southern Land of the Elves'), and determined that it would be a jumping off point for further invasion of Malinval, a possibility that did not escape the Orcs.  Orcish reinforcements arrived from the mainland and pushed the elven armies to a stalemate, neither side has ever been able to gain a decisive advantage since, as any shift in the winds brought reinforcements from the respective homelands, and neither side saw it as worth the forces it would take to push the other off the island completely.
