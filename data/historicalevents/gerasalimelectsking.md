Gerasalim Becomes Independent
The Dormanian Empire waned quickly after its meteoric rise. After Dorman I and Dorman II, a series of rather witless emperors took the throne who lost territory to the orcs, wasted resources on expensive public works projects, encouraged corruption, and lavished themselves in all the riches a continent spanning empire provides. Finally during the reign of Dorman V things came to a head. Towards the middle of his reign, in 1553, he pulled several of the legions out of southern Gerasalim in order to quell minor rebellions near the capital over exorbitant taxes (levied to pay back wages for laborers and mages involved in the construction of the Great Ramp 6 years before).

The very same year, several of the more powerful warlords took it on themselves to move northward across the mountains into Gerasalim. The weakened garrisons were overwhelmed, and by the time the legions returned in early 1554 the orcs had swept as far north as the southern shores of Lake Saria. The legion commanders, local men themselves, along with most of their men, immediately fought back, but also published a letter of support for independence from the empire. The local nobility, unable to agree on one man to lead such a kingdom did something truly unique for that time and place. They put it to a vote of the commons. Dominic Patraeus Orsellus, Commander of the 33rd Legion, was thus elected the first king of Gerasalim, Lord of Eastguard, and defender of the Blighted Gap. Dorman V, incompetent to the last, sent orders to Dominic to put down the rebellion, only to find them ignored and Northport placed under seige. Before the year was out there was not a soldier loyal to the empire left in Gerasalim.
