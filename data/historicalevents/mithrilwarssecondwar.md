The Second Mithril War
The 200 years after the end of the First Mithril War saw just enough fighting between the elves and dwarves to keep the Mithril Hills effectively abandoned, and relations tense. Then, in 1067 YFC, flames erupted over an unusual family. Born of two backwater miners, the half-elf half-dwarf children came to the attention of the elven authorities after their parents were killed by bugbears. The then king of Eldoran declared that the children were the product of rape, as no elven woman could possibly fall in love with a dwarf, and immediately declared all dwarves outlaws in Eldoran. The resulting imprisonment and execution of nearly 2000 dwarves pushed public opinion in Curinor over the edge, and calls began for punishment of the 'pointy eared dogs'.

Dwarf armies were assembled, but this time the elves pushed first. Elf armies marched from Estapor to Granite Bluff, placing the hold under siege.  Meanwhile the dwarven armies went about a defensive occupational strategy, occupying the long abandoned fortresses in the Mithril Hills, forcing out the few elven settlers in the area.  The siege of Granite Bluff became farcical in its length. No large dwarf hold has ever fallen to siege or assault, and this was no different. For 60 years the elven army stood outside the gates, and for 60 years the dwarves patiently let them, conducting trade and resupply through the underground tunnel networks that connect all the major holds of Curinor.

The elven public was fully aware of the ridiculousness of the siege, the siege camp had become like a city outside the city, with semi-permanent dwellings. As public opinion in Eldoran shifted towards recuperation, eventually support for the war waned, and in the first declared truce, the siege was lifted, the dwarves agreed to abandon the forts in the hills, and the law forbidding dwarves entrance to Eldoran was repealed.
