863






The First Mithril War
862 was an election year in Curinor.  Deep dwarves from all over voted to decide the next Under-king.  The hottest topic of the election was the future of the Mithril Hills.  Everyone recognized that firmly securing the hills for Curinor would bring vast new wealth to the kingdom, and an invaluable military asset in mithril ore.  Meanwhile Eldoran warned Curinor that electing someone who favored increased dwarven settlement would likely mean all-out war over the hills.

The dwarves by now had grown up with anti-elf propoganda, particularly the elves disrespect of dwarven mineral rights law (a big deal in dwarven society), and the elves attempt to influence the election backfired.  The dwarves elected Magar Mithrilaxe, master of a minor hold in the Mithril Hills, who pushed for extermination of the elves in the mithril hills, and an invasion of Eldoran to deter future settlement attempts.

As soon as Eldoran heard about the election they dispatched the bulk of their armies to Elathia to secure the Mithril Hills, but the dwarves were crafty.  Rather than fight the elven army in their defended forts in Elathia, the dwarves landed a massive invasion force, with the help of the Morrind, onto the Eldoran subcontinent itself.

For three weeks the dwarven army burned and pillaged its way through the elven countryside before the elven armies were able to respond effectively. When the armies finally met, the weather conditions made it impossible for either commander to control their forces. The slaughter continued for 3 days before everyone on both sides had either been killed or fled. The Under-king himself was killed on the field of battle, as well as the Crown Prince of Eldoran.

No peace treaty or truce was ever declared, but both sides ability to wage war had been destroyed, and the war for all intents and purposes was over for the time being. Indeed no leader on either side managed to rouse the spirit of war in their people again for 60 years, and the settlements in the hills were all but abandoned.
