1414






Dorman I Abdicates his Throne
In 30 years, Dorman I had taken a relatively minor city state in the hills, and turned it into the capitol of the largest empire ever to be seen on Elthelas.  He ruled more people, and controlled more territory than anyone else in a historical period where Elathia and its surrounds was dominated by massive empires.  The Neran Empire in the southeast, Malinval in the southwest the Elves to the northwest, and Dorman in the northeast.  Only Curinor stood unconquered, Dorman's one great failure.  Nevertheless at age 51, Dorman was tired of the complicated court politics that came with ruling such a vast territory.  His eldest son, a promising young man of 25 had been handling many of the administrative duties of the empire already, and was a skilled politician and general in his own right.

Equally, Dorman began to come face to face with his own mortality, and like all challenges in his life, decided it was time to overcome it.  1414 saw Dorman abdicate his throne and begin a mythical quest that would ultimately lead to his ascension to Godhood.  The details of that quest are shrouded in mystery.
