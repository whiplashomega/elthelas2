Dorman I Conquers Southern Dormania
The south of Dormania was far less populous than the Imperial heartland but nevertheless provided the first stiff resistance Dorman encountered.  Malidal in particular was ruled by a powerful and intelligent archmage who successfully countered many of Dorman's attempted tricks.  Nevertheless Dorman was successful over only a couple of years in conquering all of southern Dormania.
