Arad Colonized by Nerim
Arad had been orcish territory for a very long time, but by 1329 the Neran empire's thirst for new land had grown to the point that even war with the orcs seemed worth the risk.

The first year of the war was incredibly successful.  The orcs were disorganized and unprepared for the attack and it took only a few months for the armies to secure a sizable territory.  Their incredible success was also their undoing, as the orcs fear enabled them to unite, if only for a short time, and halt the Empires expansion.
