Human Colonists Arrive in Shendarel
30 years into their colonial experiment in Shendarel, the elves found themselves against the wall.  Orcish reinforcements had just arrived on the island from the mainland and large numbers of the elvish armies were occupied elsewhere.  Help came from an unexpected source.  

A now forgotten kingdom of humans from around the location of present day Kaland, facing pressure from aggressive neighbors, sent ships to find a new place to settle.  They stopped in Shendarel, where the local governor offered to let them settle in Shendarel.  The human king would have authority over humans, and he would have authority over elves, meanwhile the elven kings son would marry the human kings daughter.  Once the governor and human king had passed away, their children would rule jointly, with their heir to be sole ruler of Shendarel.  The elven king, distracted by other matters, signed off on the deal without looking too deeply into the details.

The human kingdom relocated its population to Shendarel within months, sending its armies ahead to help secure the new kingdom.  The Orcs were pushed back to the stalemate line, and the humans built a new city alongside the elven provincial capitol.
