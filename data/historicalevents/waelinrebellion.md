Waelin Rebellion Begins
It took less than 2 months after Darendel Se'la'mer's assencion to the thrown of Eldoran before his mismanagement of the kingdom led to rebellion. The Waelin region, the continental portion of the kingdom, balked at the King's decision to withdraw elven troops from the war with the orcs, and the Duke's of the region protested. In response, King Darendel expelled them from the court, and declared their titles void. An extreme response almost designed to lead to rebellion. The Dukes of Waelin declared Saendal Alistiae the new King of Waelin, making Estapor the defacto capitol of the new kingdom. The Eldoranian navy, and large parts of the standing army, likewise raised the Waelin flag, but Darendel refused to bend. Darendel calling for the annihilation of the traitor kingdom and all who supported it, and immediately instituted conscription in Eldoran to raise an army to wipe out the traitor kingdom. War had begun.
