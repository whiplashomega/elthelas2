Kandor Becomes Independent
In 1556, the local lords of Kandor, feeling themselves over taxed and ignored by the empire, and encouraged by the near bloodless revolution in Gerasalim, threatened to rebel unless they were granted independence and a king of their own. Dorman V, thoroughly discouraged by his utter failure in dealing with the first rebellion, granted their petition, and appointed the first King of Kandor that fall. That winter Dorman V died of heart failure, his physician said of a broken heart, while his eldest son, a renowned expert in esoteric poisons, ascended as The Esteemed Emperor of Dormania, Dorman VI.
