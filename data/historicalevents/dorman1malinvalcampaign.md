Dorman I Attempts Conquest of Northern Malinval
With Gerasalim subdued, Dorman I needed to protect his southern border from the ever aggressive Orcs.  Rather than set up defensive fortifications and hunker down as the Gerasaline Alliance had done, his ambition was greater.  His campaign was not just conquest as previous ones had been, but extermination, and for 2 years he continually pushed further into Orcish territory.  His spies moved in the circles of the Orcish warlords, breeding distrust and preventing them from working together.  Nevertheless Dorman could not maintain the campaign.  The shear size of the territory he was trying to conquer, combined with the lack of local resources to use meant his supply lines became far too long to maintain.

In 1412 he ended the campaign of conquest, and began building fortifications and bringing in colonists to maintain the territory.  The Dormanian Empire would never be larger, stretching from Curinor to the Eastern Ocean and from the Ice Ocean to the shadow of Dal Okra.
