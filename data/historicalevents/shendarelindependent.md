Shendarel gains Political Independence
It was 70 years after the inking of the deal that officially created the first half-elf ruling line that the first truly half-elf ascended to the throne in Shendarel.  Although the details of the deal had been picked apart years before by the Elvish nobility, now that the time to intervene was upon them, they found themselves unable to do so.  Several factors prevented them from doing so:

1. The young half-elf king was charismatic, skilled and popular in his kingdom.
2. The elven armies were busy fighting the dwarves of Curinor over the Mithril Hills.
3. Shendarel's standing army, bolstered by the constant need to beat back Orcish incursions, was a formidible enough force to dissuade ideas of an easy victory.
4. The new King of Shendarel offered the homeland military support against the dwarves in return for formal independence.
 
With all these factors in mind, the elven king formally signed an order granting full autonomy to Shendarel.
