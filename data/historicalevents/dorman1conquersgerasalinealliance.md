Dorman I Betrays and Conquers the Gerasaline Alliance Kingdoms
9 years before, in 1400, Dorman I had signed a treaty with the Gerasaline Alliance, promising them aid against the orcs in return for mutual non-aggression.  This was useful for Dorman so long as he remained at war with the dwarves in the north, but once peace was declared with Curinor, that peace with the Gerasaline Alliance would be short-lived.

In 1409, Dorman informed the Gerasaline Alliance that since his other wars were finished, he would be dedicating all of his legions to the defense of their southern border.  He immediately sent half of his legions to the southern border, while positioning the rest in camps in southern Kandor.  The legions in the south were there only a week when they turned on the armies of the other Gerasaline nations.  The surprised Gerasaline armies were cut off and quickly dispatched.  Meanwhile Dorman's other legions attacked the Gerasaline nations from their relatively undefended northern border.  By the end of 1409 the Gerasaline alliance was no more, it's nations nothing but conquered ruins.

Dorman was particularly harsh on the cities of Gerasalim.  He burned every settlement larger than a few hundred people to the ground, and ordered mass relocations to cities constructed by his own engineers.
