Loridesa Constructed
The elves came out of the God's War better off than most other races thanks to the protection of Sylvan.  Their population was concentrated in the southwest of the Eldoran subcontinent.  As they began to encounter threats from other races in the area they decided to form a single central government.  A council of elder druids came together and settled on the creation of a single central city and appealed to Sylvan to choose a ruler for the elves.  That city was Loridesa.
