1841






Prince of Fiends Awakens
The Prince of Fiends, comatose since the Gods War deep in the halls of Dal Okra, suddenly awoke in 1841 for unknown reasons.  Leaving his ancient tomb, his people, the Orcs, no longer recognized him.  He travelled to Marinval, where the orc chiefs were having a conference to determine how to counter the Alliance of 6 Nations and the Fortress of Light that had left so many of their armies shattered.

The guards attempted to stop the Prince of Fiends from entering for a few brief seconds before dying horribly.  The chiefs themselves tried to throw out the intruder.  It wasn't until several of them lay dead on the floor that they recognized who they truly faced.  The ancient leader of their people, the last free Sorceron, right hand of Mat'raktha, the Prince of Fiends.
