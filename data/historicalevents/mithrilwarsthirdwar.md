The Third Mithril War
The Third Mithril War involved no grand invasions or sieges, but was significant nontheless in that it kept relations tense between the elves and dwarves.  It started after a group of dwarven settlers, outcasts by dwarven standards, decided to occupy a long abandoned hold in the Mithril Hills in 1211.  Elven scouts soon discovered them there, and sent a petition to the government in Curinor to remove them, or the elves would.  The government of Curinor refused to even confirm that the settlers were there, taking a policy of purposeful ignorance.  They sent a letter back to the elves that they had sent no settlers.  The elves responded with force, sending soldiers to clear out the hold, to which the dwarves sent an official objection as armies were supposed to be prohibited from entering the Mithril Hills. Things escalated quickly from there and soon armed skirmishes were taking place.

It took 4 years for things to die down again, as both sides became tired of a war over uninhabited territory.  Representatives from both sides met and drew an official border through the Mithril Hills.
