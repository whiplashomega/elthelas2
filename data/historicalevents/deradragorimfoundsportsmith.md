1692






Dera'Dragorim takes control of Portsmith
In 1691 a group of Dormanian explorers landed in Riftlan.  They built a small fort to attempt to establish a settlement, but were unprepared for the climate and foreign diseases and began struggling almost immediately.  In early 1692, the settlers had been reduced to half their original number by starvation and disease when they were discovered by a Deran patrol ship.  Dera'Dragorim, considering the north Riftlan coast to be their homeland and territory, immediately dispatched soldiers and settlers to take control of the fort.  By the time the settlers arrived, less than a dozen of the Dormanian settlers remained, and by the next month, all had died.  

It was a strange way for Dera'Dragorim to undertake reclaiming their homeland, but the colony persisted, largely held up by its proximity to the passes into the wilds, surviving on tourism and exporting rare materials found there.
