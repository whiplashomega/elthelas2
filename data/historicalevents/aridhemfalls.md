Aridhem falls to Orcish Assault
Without the Crystal of Light, defending the Fortress of Light became much more difficult for the Alliance of 6 Nations, occupying more and more of their armies, meanwhile in late 1843, the Orcs began a concerted offensive through the Golden Pass.  By the end of 1843, the orcs had crushed the defensive fortresses in the pass and had begun a siege of the Moon Elf capitol, Aridhem.

With alliance forces still distracted attempting to defend the blighted gap, and 2 months into a siege against a far superior orcish force, Aridhem could hold out no longer.  Orcs poured into the streets as the Moon Elves attempted to flee.  The orcs, gleeful at their first major conquest of the war, burned the city to the ground, slaughtering everyone they found.  The results were nothing short of a disaster for the alliance, as the Orcs now controlled an uncontested route to the northern side of the mountains, and no significant alliance army was close enough to intercept the Orcs.
