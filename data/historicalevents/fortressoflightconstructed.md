Fortress of Light Constructed
The Creation of the Alliance of 6 Nations necessitated building a new headquarters.  They decided to build a massive fortress at the center of the Blighted Gap that would serve as the central staging ground for alliance efforts.  Construction was headed by dwarven engineers and runesmiths.  Meanwhile the elves contributed their greatest find of the modern era, a massive crystal that emitted a powerful antimagic field that stretched for miles.  The wizards of Malidal devised an elaborate control mechanism that enabled wizards and clerics inside the fortress wearing special devices could still cast spells, while other casters could not.  The field prevented unauthorized teleportation, destructive spells and more from affecting the fortress.

Over the next several decades the orcs would throw themselves at the fortress repeatedly, only to have their armies destroyed against its walls in a series of massive defeats.
