1276






Terron Colonized
The island of Terron had long been a home for tribes of gnolls and hobgoblins who fought among themselves.  In 1276 however, the growing empire of Nerim, hungry for resources and raw materials, swiftly changed that.  The disorganized locals were no match for the undead armies of Nerim, and the island was quickly conquered, and colonists soon followed.
