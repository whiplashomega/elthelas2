Se'la'mer Line Decimated
In early Amatherin of 1845, the elven King, Elrion Se'la'mer called a conference of his closest kin to decide how best to proceed in the war against the orcs. It was a conference fated for disaster. In an event hard to describe as anything other than a freak accident, a meteor landed on the building where they were meeting, killing everyone. The only remaining member of the family being Darendel Se'la'mer, a cousin who had been missing for some years, who had return to Loridesa only days before unbeknownst to his family, and recently married to a half-elf of mysterious origin. He quickly declared himself King, despite protests from the council of nobles concerning the influence of his half-breed wife and the fact that the search for survivors was not yet complete.
