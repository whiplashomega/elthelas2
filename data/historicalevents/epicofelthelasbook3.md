Epic of Elthelas Book 3: The Succession Crisis
After the Death of Dorman XXII, for the first time in the Empire's history, there was no heir from Dorman I direct line. Historians dusted off ancient tomes detailing the laws of succession, and discovered that it fell to the Council of Nobels to vote on the next Emperor. The 19 Dukes of Dormania met, and quickly fell into a stalemate, with several candidates refusing to back down and none able to acheive a majority vote. After months of indecision the Archduke of Malidal nominated a new candidate, Alexandra Ransomir, a young, capable, and devout countess from within his duchy.

As the threat of civil war loomed, Alexandra managed to secure votes from the southern Duchies, and then in a cous de gras that decided the election, secured the support of Archduke Theodore Gloryheart, the reknowned war hero, who brought with him the support of several of the central duchies and the capitol itself. With the vote complete, the capitol came under attack by the forces of Hell itself, clearly bent on changing the result of the election. Alexandra, now Empress Dormana I, sent her bravest soldiers to face these enemies, who defeated the Pit Fiend that led them before General Heartbren, leader of the Black Wolf Irregulars, managed to drive off the remaining hordes.

Despite the glorious victory of Alexandra, the second place finisher in the election, Manius Aquila, refused to recognize the result, declaring Theodore Gloryheart illegitimate and his vote illegal. He fled to his capitol in Farengar and raised his flag in rebellion, declaring himself the true Emperor of Dormania.
