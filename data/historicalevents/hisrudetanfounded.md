Zelfir and Hisru'de'tan founded
Following the Enchanter's imprisonment, a great debate occurred among the Hisru regarding where to settle.  One group saw arcane magic as the key that saved their people, and were determined to rebuild their home as a mageocracy.  Others saw it as the tool by which the Enchanter had kept them imprisoned, and rejected arcane magic entirely.  As the debate progressed those who saw arcane magic as a tool of evil came together and decided to leave.  They called themselves 'the protected in exile' or Hisru'de'tan, and travelled east, eventually forming a society of wandering tribes.  Meanwhile those who stayed founded the nation of Zelfir, or 'Homeland'.
