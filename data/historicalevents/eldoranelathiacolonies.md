Eldoran founds first elven colonies on Elathia
For the first 800 or so years of their history the elves were an insular people, trading a little with the Morrind, but otherwise keeping to themselves on the huge forested subcontinent of Eldoran.  It was in the 5th century YFC that that changed, as pressures of population growth and a desire for natural resources not available on Eldoran had them sending ships to other places.  They founded colonies on the main continental body of Elathia, and for the next 300 years they would continually expand into that land, only stopping when they encountered strong organized resistance from the dwarves of Curinor and the ancient Gerasaline city states.
