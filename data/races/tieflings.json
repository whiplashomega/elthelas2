  "description": "\n\nTieflings are the descendents of humans that have mated with demons or devils, they bear the mark of this touch in their appearance and nature. They often bear demonic traits, such as horns, forked tails or tongue, or reddish skin or eyes. They also tend towards evil more than the average person, and although this is far from a given, it is common enough that the distrust that follows them everywhere is justified.\n\nTieflings are not quite as rare as Aasimar (given demons' proclivity for lust), although they are still rare enough to cause a stir in any town they show up in, especially given their heritage. Tieflings are more common in the west, where demons, and demon attacks, are also more common. Tieflings of a good or neutral persuasion can usually find shelter in Dera'Dragorim or Zelfir, the second as a service to Amathera as a pity of their natural plight, and the first in recognition of a shared victimization at the hands of aggressive demon invaders.\n\n#### Tiefling Culture in Elthelas\n\nThe distrust that tieflings face at the hands of common folk, combined with the chaos in their blood, leads many to take up life as an adventurer or wanderer. Some find their way to the tiefling enclaves in more friendly cities, while many find themselves taken advantage of by evil lords who give them opportunities where no one else would. The largest population of settled Tiefling's in Elthelas is in the Deran city of Vasha. There it is common enough to see someone with horns or a forked tongue walking down the street that few pay it any mind. The Tiefling's there have found a niche working as alchemists, smelters and smiths, as well as other jobs where their natural resistances give them an edge over an ordinary human. These Tieflings are well integrated into Dera'Dragoran society.\n\nElsewhere in the world tieflings have evolved their own counter cultures. For example, In Malinval Tieflings are subject only to the church of Mat'raktha, and have a near monopoly on intercity trade, since they are the only race not subject to the warlords or mandatory slavery.",

      "description": "At the time of the demon invasion, Dera was home to the largest elven community outside of Eldoran. Unfortunately for these elves, their community was among the first attacked by the demons. Throughout most of the world it is believed that all of the elves were slaughtered, however a small percentage were kept as slaves, serving the whims of their demon masters, and subject to their lusts. Many of them died birthing the demonic offspring of these unions, and those who did not were rendered infertile. When Bahamut turned his wrath on the demons, forcing them to flee, they left their slaves, and their offspring, behind. These elves, trapped between an angry God and demon slave-masters, hid in the sewers of the ruined city, where they have lived since, expanding them as they had need of space. Over time they have intermarried and the demonic blood has spread and become diluted throughout their people. Today they rarely leave their underground home, but occasionally one will leave to travel the world. They are typically mistaken for a pointy eared , skinny and winged tiefling, and they rarely find a welcoming reception. Most return home.\n\nFey'ri have a naturally evil disposition, and the society as a whole has largely given into the call of their blood. The underworks of Dera where they live is a harsh environment where only the strongest are permitted to survive.\n\n",
