  "description": "\n\nOrcs are primarily characterized by their great strength. They are slightly taller than humans, and much more muscular, with green to mottled brown skin, large noses, a prominent brow-ridge and an underbite featuring tusks. While they are stereotyped as being stupid, evil, and cruel, only the last 2 are usually true. They are also the most populous race in the world save humans, and had they the same room to expand, they probably would have outbred humans long ago.\n\nOrcs are also generally tribal, and orcish society revolves around rule by the strongest. Unfortunately this does not lead to stable societies, but rather warlords who rise and fall, usually within a few years, and who war amongst themselves. These warlords are generally High Orcs, a breed that has long separated itself from their kin, favoring skill in leadership or sorcerous magic over pure brute strength. Far to the south, in Nerim, the Sand Orc tribes roam.",
