  "description": "\n\nHalf-Elves are incredibly rare in most of the world, but in the eastern areas of Eldoran and southwest Gerasalim, where elves and humans have lived side by side for generations, it sometimes seems as if every other person is a half-elf. Half-elves share some of the chiseled facial features of their elven parentage, while retaining some of the versatility and adaptability of their human forbears.\n\n",
  "traits": [
    "Ability Score Increase: Your Charisma score increases by 2 and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.",
    "Size: Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is medium.",
    "Darkvision: Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.",
    "Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.",
    "Skill Versatility: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice."
