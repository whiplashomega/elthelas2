    "description": "\n\nThe Dwarves suffered a difficult split at the end of God's War, one large group of them found themselves abandoned on a chain of islands, while the biggest group was in the center of the large easter continent, Elathia, and under constant attack by orcs and trolls. Since then those trapped on the islands have become the most adept sailors in the world, finding safety and wealth on the sea. The others have found homes in both mountains and plains, and have formed a caste-based republic.\n\nThis has split the dwarves into 4 distinct sub-races, that although they are capable of interbreeding, rarely do.",
