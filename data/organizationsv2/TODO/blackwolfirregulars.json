  "description": "The Black Wolf Irregulars are a mercenary organization that has existed in northern [Elathia](/geo/continents/elathia) for the last 200 years or so, hiring themselves out by company to various militaries. They have a history of taking in those who don't fit into a standard military structure and coming up with unusual tactics designed to take advantage of them. After the formation of the [Alliance of 6 Nations](/org/allianceof6nations) they were hired en masse by the same to be a cross-national force that worked strictly for the Alliance as a whole. The Irregulars typically work in small squads on the peripheries of major battles, handling scouting missions, infiltration missions, and other missions that require unusual or specialized training for a small number of individuals.\n\nDespite their reputation for success and loyalty to their contractors, they still tend to be distrusted by national professional militaries.",
