  "description": "The Black Sun is a loose international organization of thieves, cutthroats, assassins, and bandits.  They have a presence in most major cities throughout the world, however there is no strong central leadership.  Each local branch will typically have it's own guildmaster, and it's own call signs and codes in addition to the more global thieve's cant.  Members who travel can usually expect to find safeharbor in local chapterhouses, but little trust or aid.\n\nSimilarly it is not uncommon for different branches of the Black Sun to work at cross purposes. It is common for branches to be clandestinely payed for espionage work by one government, only for their opponents to pay a different branch for the same work.\n\nMembership in the Black Sun is membership for life, in that if you try and leave or betray the Black Sun they will hunt you down and kill you.",
