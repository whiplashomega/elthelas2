  "description": "The Trollkin Mercenary Corps is the official diplomatic arm of Degak'Ta, but membership is not restricted to citizens of Degak'Ta or Trollkin.  They are an elite group of mercenaries who will sign up for any conflict for the right price, even different sides of the same conflict. Once contracted they are known to be extremely loyal and impartial, governed by the contract they are given until it expires.  Further they are known to be among the best warriors in the world, so being able to afford Trollkin Mercenaries is considered extremely prestigious.",
