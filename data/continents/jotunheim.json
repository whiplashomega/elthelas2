  "name": "Jotunheim",
  "description": "While most of the world knows nothing of the land of Jotunheim beyond the legends told by giants in their midst, the giants throughout the world know very well that their ancient home is still a very real place. Far in the freezing north, much of the year Jotunheim is unreachable by ship, as ice blocks the way. The giants dominate the land. Only a few small colonies of primitive people in the far south lie outside of the giants domain, but even there the giants regularly raid, taking slaves and asserting their dominance.",
