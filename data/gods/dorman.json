Dorman is highly revered among the noble houses of Dormania, where his very existence proves to them their divine right to rule, as well as among generals and officers in various armies around the world.\n\nThe clergy of Dorman are often retired military officers and usually command a large force of citizen militia. They often ride out to war with the armies not as chaplains but as fellow warriors, committing themselves to where the battle is hottest to bring victory and conquest for their king and God.",
