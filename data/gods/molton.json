He also finds some devotees among sorcerers and wizards who admire the power of fire.\n\nMolton's temples tend to be in remote locations near volcanoes and other places where the power of fire is apparent. For example, the elves have built a shrine to Molton at the top of the Glass Cliff. His priests keep great fires burning in the temples at all times, where clothing is shed in the warmth of the blaze and inhibitions lowered. Women who have had trouble conceiving often come to the temples of Molton to receive his blessing. Each year at midsummer the priests of Molton hold the rite of purification, in which the devout walk through fire. After doing so evil deeds are considered washed away.",
