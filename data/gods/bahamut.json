In Dera'Dragorim, the priests of Bahamut are responsible for watching over the clutches of dragon eggs until they hatch. When the first crack appears a celebration begins, and the mother is magically summoned so that imprinting can occur. Another such celebration occurs whenever someone undertakes the ritual of dragonbirth.",

Their inheritance, such as it is, is usually donated to the church. In return they serve the dragons that serve as the protectors of Dera'Dragorim, and communicate to them the needs of the people.",
