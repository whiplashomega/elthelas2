Scholars are only aware of the change by the occasional change in Vrasja's appearance, gender, and sometimes even minor changes to the tenets and demands made of her clerics.\n\nVrasja is a Goddess with ever shifting alliances. In the days of the Gods War she shifted sides constantly just to keep the war going, and the blood flowing. Where Nera represents natural death, reincarnation, and the normal order of things, Vrasja is the epitome of death by violence, gaining power with each mortal cut down in their prime.",
