He has many worshipers among the orcs and hobgoblins, and there is an underground cult of Malik among the trollkin as well.\n\nMalik's clergy rarely establish temples, rather they go out seeking to create chaos, often joining with armies. Military units that worship Malik tend to be disorganized irregulars that strike out at their enemies in unpredictable ways, and are granted powerful blessings and great strength in return.",
