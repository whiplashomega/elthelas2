Occasionally gnomes from Stagenheim who live deep within their caves will also take up the worship of Dorun, but for them it does not resonate quite so strongly.",

        "appearance": "Dorun appears as a middle-aged but still powerful looking dwarf, bald but with a long graying red braided beard.  He wears robes of black and gold studded with gemstones.",
        "dogma": "Dorun takes great pleasure in song, especially those that resonate throughout his caverns and caves. Even bar songs in the depths of the Dwarven holds contain complicated harmony and counterpoint that is only enhanced when heard from 20 or 30 miles away as it echoes through chamber after chamber. Hymns are even more complicated. He further encourages his followers to delve deeply into the earth in search of rare metals and new places to call home. Magic runes were a gift of Dorun to dwarven bards and wizards who were great composers. The deep resonant tones of the dwarven voice are most suited to His worship, but higher tones and instruments are not turned away.",
        "clergy": "The clergy of Dorun are often great singers or composers. They often dedicate new holds and caverns with their first songs personally. They also enforce the caste system of dwarven society, refusing to dedicate caverns that are to be the home of any who have lived on the surface, for to be separated from the song of Dorun is to be separated from God.",
