But even before the time of the Gods War their dominion began to wane. Constant wars with the Dragons and the mortal races took their toll, and soon their were not enough giants to maintain their dominion. Annam created a homeland for the giants at the top of the world, cold and unforgiving, mirrored after his own home of Nephelheim. While small groups of giants still dot the world, most have retreated to this ancient home.",
