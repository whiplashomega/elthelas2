        "dogma": "Any person who nurtures a plants growth is considered to be worshiping Sara. In the spring and in the fall the priests of Sara perform rituals to garner Sara's blessings on the planting and harvest in which the entire community usually participates. These rituals tend to be holidays for the entire community. Sara's blessings are usually subtle, such as more grain in the granary than was growing in the field, or plants that produce past the frost or more fruit than is typical. She rewards her most devout with an unusual knowledge of plants and how to achieve the best harvest possible.",
