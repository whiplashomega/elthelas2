  "name": "Cur'Estan",
  "description": "Cur'Estan is the fortress headquarters of the Black Wolf Irregulars, a paramilitary mercenary organization that works out of Alliance territory, and has a large long-term contract to provide support to Alliance armies. The fortress of Cur'Estan was an old abandoned keep in the woods of Kandor, first built during Dorman I war with the dwarves over their eastern holds as a supply dump and staging area for the imperial army. When the founders of the Black Wolf Irregulars discovered it, they bought it from the lumberjacks who owned the land and after making their fortune adventuring, set about restoring the fortress.",
