  "name": "Cur'Estan",
  "description": "Cur'Estan is the fortress headquarters of the Black Wolf Irregulars, a paramilitary mercenary organization that works out of Alliance territory, and has a large long-term contract to provide support to Alliance armies. The fortress of Cur'Estan was an old abandoned keep in the woods of Kandor, first built during Dorman I war with the dwarves over their eastern holds as a supply dump and staging area for the imperial army. When the founders of the Black Wolf Irregulars discovered it, they bought it from the lumberjacks who owned the land and after making their fortune adventuring, set about restoring the fortress.\n\nWith the recent breakup of the Alliance of 6 Nations, Kandor remains the only reliable funding nation for the Black Wolf Irregulars.  Meanwhile their numbers have been decimated as they repeatedly have attempted to shore up defenses and weak points on the southern borders, only to have the orcs overwhelm them.  Only one of their founding members remains alive, General Gerad Heartbren, a now aging Moon Elf desparate to save a world crumbling around him.\n\nGeneral Heartbren has put out a call for recruitment, and is rapidly burning through what remains of his personal fortune, to make Cur'Estan into a new beacon of hope for all those who hope to stop the spread of evil in the world.",
