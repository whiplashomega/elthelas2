  "name": "Nerim",
  "description": "Nerim was once the seat of the Neran Empire, a monotheistic continent spanning empire. It was here that the great spell was cast that turned the population of the continent into armies of the undead, millions strong. The city still stands, largely undamaged, preserved by the dry air, and the inability of growing things to survive in the lingering negative energy presence.",
