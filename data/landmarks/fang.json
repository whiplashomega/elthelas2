  "name": "Fang",
  "description": "The white mountain, Fang, is the center of Sand Orc society. The mountain is home to an extensive system of natural caves, which they have greatly enlarged, and several cool springs that supply an abundance of water. As such it serves as trading post and wintering location for the Sand Orcs. It is also the location their chiefs meet in order to discuss any matters that involve all of the tribes. It is a place of peace, and no sand orc is allowed to raise a hand against another while at or near Fang.",
