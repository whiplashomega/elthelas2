  "name": "Gaia's Grove",
  "description": "The Dreaming Goddess, Gaia, Who Dreams No More. Such is the line the druids have told in recent months, encouraging pilgrims to come to the wild island of Gnarra to see the hidden grove where Gaia, until recently, slept. About 20 miles in from the south coast of Gnarra the grove is guarded by the Faelin, who speak little about the events that led to the Goddess awakening, only saying she was 'saved' by a group of adventurers and a mighty druid. No one will say what she was saved from.\n\nThe grove itself has only 1 small entrance, with no other path through the tangle of branches and trees that form an impenetrable dome around the living altar.",
