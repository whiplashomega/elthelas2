  "name": "Great Ramp",
  "description": "The Great Ramp was built by Dorman III and Dorman IV to connect the wizards college at Malidal with the rest of the empire without having to travel hundreds of miles overland. It was a massive public works project that employed nearly 300,000 people during a period of relative peace for the Empire and construction took 23 years.\n\nDorman III began construction in 1524 after his requests for aid from the college during the Nerim Cataclysm took months to arrive.  When he died in battle against the orcs in 1530 his brother, Dorman IV took the throne and continued the project.  Shortly after its completion Dorman IV died of an apparent heart attack.",
