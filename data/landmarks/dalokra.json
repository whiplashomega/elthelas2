  "name": "Dal Okra",
  "description": "Literally in Orcish \"Dal Okra\" means Home of the Orcs. It is an ancient name for the place of legend where the orc race was first created. Whether that was actually the huge black mountain called Dal Okra today is a question for debate, as that history was lost in the God's War. Dal Okra today is a huge empty tomb, once holding the Prince of Fiends, a believed dead Sorceron, who once commanded at least part of the orc legions in the God's War before he was struck down by Michael, the Archangel of Alohim. Now he is awake again, and has taken nearly complete control of the orcish tribes.",
