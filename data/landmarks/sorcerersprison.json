  "description": "The Sorcerer's Prison is believed to be the single greatest work of magic since the God's War. Created by the wizards of Zelfir to contain their once master, a powerful Sorceron enchanter of unknown name, it is a huge magical barrier which it is possible to enter from the outside, but impossible to get out of from within. The barrier forms a massive sphere, with the center at ground level such that it is impossible to fly or dig oneself out. The surface of the barrier is silvery and impossible to see through. The barrier has stood for thousands of years without anyone ever escaping.",
