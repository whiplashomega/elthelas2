  "name": "Fortress of Light",
  "description": "The Fortress of Light is a massive joint venture defensive fortress and staging facility manned by dwarves, humans, and elves from Gerasalim, Dormania, Kandor, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran. It is the central supply dump and gathering point for campaigns and troop movements in the defense against attacking orcs, trolls, gnolls, and various goblinoids coming across arid plain known as the Blighted Gap.\n\nThe fortress itself is built surrounding a small springfed lake, and covers nearly 3 square miles. It's outer wall extend up 150 feet of sheer stone braced with adamantium, without joint or crack, and they are nearly 15 foot thick. Several large inner keeps, built similarly to the outer wall, extend up some 200-250 feet. Large counterspelling crystals instantly counter any spell cast at or near the fortress. A dry moat, filled with thick steel spikes, extends out 25 feet from the edge of the wall.\n\nAfter the second fall of Aridhem, and the withdrawal of elven and dormanian armies, the Fortress of Light found itself without sufficient soldiers to man the walls, and cut off from resupply. It took only a month for the orcs to breach the walls and take the fortress after that point. Although the defenders inflicted massive casualties on the orcs, they were slaughtered to a man.\n\nNow the Fortress is the forward base of orcish operations in the north.",
