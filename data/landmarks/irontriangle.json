  "name": "Iron Triangle",
  "description": "The Iron Triangle is three fortresses built equidistant from each other in northeast Nerim, each about half a mile from the other two. In their day the three fortresses were the greatest defensive structure in the world, although they never endured much test beyond disorganized rebel groups. Today they are (mostly) uninhabited ruins, but they are still imposing and difficult to capture should anyone choose to defend them.",
