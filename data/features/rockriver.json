  "name": "Rock River",
  "description": "The rock river runs through the heart of curinor, pulling its source waters from the Runic Mountains and the Mithril Hills. It feeds farms and communities of plains dwarves all along its length, who named it 'Rock' so they could claim to live close to the 'Rock', raising their status among their peers. This reinforced the increased wealth and opportunity that access to fresh water provided them, and meshed with the traditional dwarven caste system, allowing the surface living plains dwarves to have their own system of status despite being the lowest outcasts among dwarven society as a whole.",
