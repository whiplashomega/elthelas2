  "name": "Liga River",
  "description": "Literally translating from orcish as \"Small River\". The Liga's watershed is a relatively sparsely populated area largely separated from the rest of Malinval both physically and culturally. Where the large population centers of central and northern Malinval have consistently sat on a wartime footing, the villages and small cities along the Liga have almost always just kept to themselves.",
