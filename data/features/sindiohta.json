  "name": "Sindi Ohta",
  "description": "Literally translated 'War River', Sindi Ohta was for many years the semi-official boundary between Eldoran and Curinor, with the dwarves controlling the Mithril Hills beyond. As the elves continued to gain power and the dwarves military might slowly receded, the border pushed further and further to the north and east, beyond the river, until today it sits 50-100 miles beyond, running through the northern part of the mithril hills and terminating at the Fortress of Light, with the western part of the border changing from Eldoran to Demal Thor half way between.\n\nThe land surrounding the river is sparsely populated, with the only settlement of any size being Storval, a minor elvish city that sits astride the trade routes coming west from Gerasalim and Curinor.",
