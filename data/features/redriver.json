  "description": "Zelfir produces the best steel outside of Parakas, and the reason shows up in their famous red river. The river gets its color from the iron ore that lines its bed and washes down from the mines in the hills. The ore is not special, but the quantity of untapped reserves means iron is cheap, and so smelters have more leeway to experiment with alloys without wasting expensive raw materials. While they have not been able to mimic the famous red steel produced from the iron of the rust desert, the smelters of the red river valley are truly skilled artisans.\n\nOutside of the steel industry, the red river also provides the bulk of water supplies for Zelfin and much of the countryside of Zelfir.",
