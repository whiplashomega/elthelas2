  "name": "Blighted Gap",
  "description": "The Blighted Gap is an arid waste, once part of the fertile plain that makes up the bulk of Demal Thor, Curinor, and Southern Gerasalim, nothing grows in the area any longer after centuries of warfare on that ground with destructive magic used liberally on both sides. It is bordered on the west by Demal Thor, on the north by Curinor, to the east by Gerasalim and to the south by Malinval. The gap is also home to many strange monsters that feed off of the latent magical energy that has built up there over time, often drawn to the sites of old battlefields between groups of mages. The north edge of the gap is dotted with fortresses, by far the largest of which is the massive Fortress of Light.",
