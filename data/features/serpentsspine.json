  "name": "Serpents Spine",
  "description": "The Serpent's Spine is a lengthy underwater ridge that rises to within about 50 feet of sea level along its length, and is covered in coral reef above that tall enough to break the surface in most places. The spine goes for hundreds of miles north and south, separating the isles of the Morrindim from the Atyrean continent. It is impassable by ship except through magical means, which means most traders and ship captains simply go around.",
