  "name": "Demon Peaks",
  "description": "The Demon Peaks are a string of mountains in far west Riftlan, running north from the Sorcerer's Prison along the western edge of the veldt. So named because they are the refuge of the demons who survived the wrath of Bahamut after the fall of Dera. The Demons there are generally disorganized, spending much of their time hunting the creatures of the veldt for food and sport, yet there are rumors that a great Demon Lord remains high in the mountains, in a fortress of his own construction.",
