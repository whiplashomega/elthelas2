  "name": "Undead Woods",
  "description": "The first major conflict of the Mithril Wars saw the dwarves attempt to invade Eldoran in force. They landed a large army on the northeast shore of Eldoran, and started a campaign of destruction through the forests there, forcing the residents to flee or be killed. The elves were taken by surprise, expecting the dwarves to attack elsewhere. When they finally were able to field a significant enough army to take on the dwarves assault, the battle was long and bloody, and neither side gave up an inch until only a bare fragment of either army remained, and the fighting had continued for 6 days. Finally, the dwarves retreated, leaving behind their dead and making for the shore, where the Morrind ships that had taken them there waited. As time passed rumors began to spread that the woods where that final battle had taken place, and all the area that the dwarves had laid waste to were haunted, and those who tried to resettle that land were never heard from again. Today they are called the Undead Woods, and they are forbidden ground.",
