  "name": "Yellow River",
  "description": "A silty, oft-flooding mess of a river, the yellow river is named for the yellow color it gets every time it floods (which it does at least once every spring). These floods provide fertile soil for the eastern farming communities of Dormania. The river in fact, is two rivers that meet a mere 30 miles from the coast, named, appropriately, the West Yellow River and the East Yellow River.",
