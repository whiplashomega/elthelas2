  "name": "Rust Desert",
  "description": "The Rust Desert is dry yes, but not actually dry enough to be classified a desert in most circumstances. Rather nothing grows there because the entire several thousand square mile area is a massive pit filled with tiny rusted iron filings. Believed to contain more than 90% of the world's accessible iron, its origin is unknown, although it is considered a major strategic resource, and has changed hands multiple times between the orcs and the Dormanian Empire.",
