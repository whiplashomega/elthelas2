  "description": "The Ara river, like the Sindi Silme-Ranna, runs for much of its length directly under the orbit of the moon Ara. Feeding into Saria Lake at it's southwest termination, it combines with the Sindi Okra to form the longest river system in the world. It brings a variety of goods down from the heart of Gerasalim down to Saria Lake and the capitol at Strovenguard, and forms an important leg in the trade routes with Dormania.",
