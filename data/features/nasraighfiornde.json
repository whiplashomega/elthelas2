  "name": "Nasraigh Fiornde",
  "description": "The wide strait between the Island of Eldoran and the Elathian continent is one of the busiest trade routes in the world. The elven navy ensures the security of merchantmen (in return for a sizable tax) and it is the only connection between Morrindim, Dera'Dragorim, Kandor, and Dormania that doesn't go through orc controlled waters. The name translates to The Narrow Ruby Throat, and comes from a time when the tax was equal to 'the value of a ruby the size of an elves thumbnail', and the punishment for attempting to evade the tax was death by slitting of the throat. Since then the Morrind have successfully lobbied for the tax to be reduced and the punishment less severe (now it is imprisonment and a lengthy fine), but the name nevertheless remains.",
