  "name": "Desert of Despair",
  "description": "Located just south and east of the Glass Cliff in Malinval, the Desert of Despair is a hot desolate place that despite its relative proximity to the coast, rain somehow never falls and the wind never blows. It is sandy and barren, yet unlike the typical sandy desert, there are no dunes, but it is unnaturally flat throughout. Once, as a dare, a group of orcs thought to see if they could dig deep enough in the sand to find something other than sand. They dug down close to 500 feet before their hole collapsed on top of them.",
