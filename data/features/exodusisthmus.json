  "name": "Exodus Isthmus",
  "description": "Named for the flight from Zelfir of the Hisru people of Hisru'de'tan, the isthmus connects the continents of Atyrea and Riftlan with a strip of land 10 miles wide and 80 miles long. A distance not impossible for a small ship to portage if necessary, and port towns along the coasts often have gangs of workers who will hire themselves out to do just that, bringing ships from the Dragon Sea to the Mermaid Sea and back again.",
