  "name": "Golden Pass",
  "description": "The Golden Pass lies between Demal Thor and Malinval, and has been a common invasion route for the orcs. On the Demal Thor side the ancient fortress city of Aridhem, the only permanent settlement of the Moon Elves, guards the pass. The pass itself is named as it is because of the way it shines in the sun, however prospectors who have braved the journey come back with little worth risking a mining venture in such a dangerous territory.",
