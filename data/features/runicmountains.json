  "name": "Runic Mountains",
  "description": "After the Gods War, a group of dwarves led by a young warrior named Curin found themselves living in an unusual natural cave system deep in the mountains of central Elathia. The walls of the caves were covered in a script that none alive could read, but which the dwarves called 'runes'. The mountains themselves soon took the name, becoming the 'Runic Mountains', and over time dwarven scholars would learn to decipher the writings, and discovered their magical import.\n\nToday that original cave system is lost, perhaps destroyed to make room for some dwarven hold or other, but the name remains as a herald that 'here there be dwarves', and pointing the way to the largest, most imposing natural mountain formation in the world.",
