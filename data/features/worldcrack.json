  "name": "World Crack",
  "description": "The World Crack is a massive canyon that separates the bulk of Dormania from Gerasalim, Malinval, and Arad. The Crack is roughly a mile and a half deep at its deepest, about 600 miles long, and about 80 miles wide at its widest point. Most of the canyon is filled with water at the bottom. The crack is a remnant of the God's War, and whatever cataclysmic event caused it is lost to history. The city of Malidal is built on a magically-supported platform at the water level on the Dormanian side of the crack at a low point in the wall. A long ramp leads down the approximately 3000 feet to get to its level over a length of about 15 miles. Two major rivers drain into the canyon, one at the northern terminus, and the other near Malidal, both river mouths are a sight to behold as the water cascades several thousand feet down in a great waterfall.",
