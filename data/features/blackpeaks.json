  "name": "Black Peaks",
  "description": "The imposing mountain range blocking the way between Gerasalim and Malinval gets its name from the black specked granite, onyx, and other volcanic rock that make up much of the rock in the area. It is theorized that the mountains were created during the Gods War by the Gods themselves pulling magma and rock up from the heart of the earth to destroy each others armies. Regardless of how they were created, the mountains today serve as an imposing border and stopgap from orcish invasion for Gerasalim.",
