  "name": "Dina River",
  "description": "The Dina River has its head waters in the Runic Mountains, running east and south from there into the northern tip of Saria Lake. The exact origin of the river is unknown outside of the Deep Dwarves, as the head waters run out of massive fortified dwarven fortresses, although it is known that the underground river runs as far as Highhammer on the far side of the mountains, allowing the dwarves to send their trade goods east as well as west.",
