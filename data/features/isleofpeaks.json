  "name": "Isle of Peaks",
  "description": "A massive mountainous island off the coast of Malinval, it is almost like a river delta gone wrong with it's place at the mouth of the Sindi Okra. The island was an ordinary flat river delta until the Gods raised Titan's Peaks around Nerim to the southeast. The following decades saw massive volcanic activity in the surrounding oceans and islands, turning the island of Tenecha, and Sindi Okra's river delta into large mountainous areas, as well as the formation of a number of small isolated volcanic islands, including the particularly large island of Marinda.\n\nToday the Isle of Peaks is home to several large warring tribes of hobgoblins, gnolls, and bugbears.",
