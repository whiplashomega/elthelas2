  "name": "Sindi Okra",
  "description": "Sindi Okra, when considered together with the Ara River (which really is the same river on the other side of Saria Lake), is the longest river system in the world. The Sindi Okra branch, literally translated from Elvish to mean Orc Waters, runs from Saria Lake south through the blighted gap, past Makir, Marinval, and Gulutheim to finally flow into the south sea 6000 miles south of the headwaters of the Ara. Despite crossing through a major war zone, the river acts as a primary conduit for trade across large swaths of the continent, although by the time it reaches Gulutheim the water is so poluted as to be completely undrinkable.",
