  "description": "Flowing westward from it's headwaters above Aridhem to its final termination at Estapor, The River of the Moon Elves was the migration route for the eastward flowing settlers from Eldoran who settled Demal Thor. The river's route points in the direction of the largest moon of Elthelas, Ara, giving the moon elves their original name, 'those who follow the moon'. Today it provides an avenue for trade for the two elven nations, and an important connection to the sea for Demal Thor.",
