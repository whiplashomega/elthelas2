{
  "name": "Boundary River",
  "description": "The Boundary River runs on a northeast - southwest course through Riftlan, some 80-100 miles north west of Last Watch and the official patrolled border of Zelfir. It is generally considered to mark the final boundary between civilization and the areas inhabited by man, and the wild, untamed central Veldt. Only the trading post and fortress Saldan is known to lie further north anywhere west of the Dragonhome Mountains. Between the river and the fort lies 150 miles of grassland without a single human inhabitant outside of the occasional hermit.",
