  "name": "Dragon's Teeth",
  "description": "The Dragon's Teeth Mountains mark the border between Eldoran and Demal Thor.  They are only sparsely populated, with a few border forts concentrated near the Moon Pass.  Because the elves have few if any settlements nearby, there are a number of kobold mines, gnoll forts, and free goblin clans that inhabit the area.",
