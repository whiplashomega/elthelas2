You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.\n\nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn."

      "description": "Your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.\n\nYou have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.\n\nYou cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending an action in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 120 ft of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, and the creatures’ general direction and distance from you, but not their numbers or other attributes.\n\nIf there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group."

      "description": "By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.\n\n#### Spell Slots\n\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\n\n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier."

          "name": "Animal Companion",
          "description": "At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.\n\nWith 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.\n\nAt the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion’s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.\n\nIf your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion’s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.\n\nIf you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.\n\n#### Companion's Bond\n\nYour animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.\n\nThe animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.\n\nThe companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.\n\nWhen using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.\n\n#### Keeping Track of Proficiency\n\nWhen you gain your animal companion at 3rd level, its proficiency bonus matches yours at +2. As you gain levels and increase your proficiency bonus, remember that your companion’s proficiency bonus improves as well, and is applied to the following areas: Armor Class, skills, saving throws, attack bonus, and damage rolls.\n\nYour animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.\n\nYour animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.\n\nFor each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.\n\nWhenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.\n\nYour companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, \"The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life.\"\n\n#### Why no Multiattack?\n\nMultiattack is a useful design tool that keeps monsters simple for the DM. It provides a boost in offense, but that boost is meant to make a beast threatening for one battle—a notion that doesn’t mesh well with a beast intended to fight with the party, rather than against it. Project Multiattack across an entire adventure, and an animal companion runs the risk of outclassing the fighters and barbarians in the party.\n\nSo in story terms, your animal companion has traded in some of its ferocity (in the form of Multiattack) for better awareness and the ability to fight more effectively in concert with you.\n\n#### Expanding Companion Options\n\nDepending on the nature of your campaign, the DM might choose to expand the options for your animal companion. As a rule of thumb, a beast can serve as an animal companion if it is Medium or smaller, has 15 or fewer hit points, and cannot deal more than 8 damage with a single attack. In general, that applies to creatures with a challenge rating of 1/4 or less, but there are exceptions.\n\nYour animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features."
