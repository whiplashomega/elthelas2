      "description": "You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\n#### Archery\n\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.\n\n#### Defense\n\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n\n#### Dueling\n\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\n\n#### Great Weapon Fighting\n\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\n\n#### Protection\n\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.\n\n#### Two-Weapon Fighting\n\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.\n\n#### Blind Fighting\n\nYou have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you are blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.\n\n#### Interception\n\nWhen a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simle or martial weapon to use this reaction.\n\n#### Superior Technique\n\nYou learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).\n\nYou gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). The die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n#### Thrown Weapon Fighting\n\nYou can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.\n\nIn addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.\n\n#### Unarmed Fighting\n\nYour unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.\n\nAt the start of each of your turns you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you."

          "name": "Combat Superiority",
          "description": "When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.\n\n**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under \"Maneuvers\" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.\n\nYou learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\n\n**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.\n\n**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\nManeuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).\n\n#### Maneuvers\n\nThe maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**Commander’s Strike.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n**Disarming Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.\n\n**Distracting Strike.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.\n\n**Evasive Footwork.** When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.\n\n**Feinting Attack.** You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet o f you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n**Goading Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Lunging Attack.** When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n**Maneuvering Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack. \n\n**Menacing Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Parry.** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.\n\n**Precision Attack.** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.\n\n**Pushing Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.\n\n**Rally.** On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.\n\n**Riposte.** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\n**Sweeping Attack.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\n\n**Trip Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.\n\n**Ambush.** When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend on superioriy die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.\n\n**Bait and Switch** When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n\nRoll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.\n\n**Brace** When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you're wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superioriy die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.\n\n**Commanding Presence.** When you make a Charisma (Intimidation), a Charisma (Performance), or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.\n\n**Grappling Strike.** Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and then try to grapple the target as a bonus action (see the Player's Handbook for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n**Quick Toss.** As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.\n\n**Tactical Assessment.** When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), an Intelligence (History), or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check."

Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.\n\nThe following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune.

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n**Stone Rune.** This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nIn addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your raection to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw.

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.\n\nIn addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute, or until you're incapacitated. Until this state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage.
