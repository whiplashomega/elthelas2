  "name": "Acolyte",
  "description": "You have spent your life in the service o f a temple to a specific god or pantheon o f gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm o f the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence o f the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\n\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature o f your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader o f a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.",
