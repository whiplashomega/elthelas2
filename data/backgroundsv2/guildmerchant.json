  "name": "Guild Merchant",
  "description": "Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a guild o f traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works o f others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.",
