  "description": "Of the dwarven holds, Granite Bluff is the most cosmopolitan.  Dwarves in general maintain a perilous majority of the population, with about 30% of the population being hill dwarves, another 20% plains dwarves and 2-3% deep dwarves.  The rest of the population is a mix of half-dwarves, moon elves, half-elves, and humans.  This is largely because Granite Bluff acts as a gateway point in a series of trade routes connecting the western plains of Curinor, the mountainous east of Curinor, northeast Eldoran, Demal Thor, and Gerasalim.  While more southerly routes are faster when moving between Gerasalim and Demal Thor, their proximity to the Blighted Gap makes them subject to orc raids and monster attacks.  Hugging the hills of Curinor and stopping in Granite Bluff is a much safer route, and is the official trade road patrolled (and taxed) by Curinor.\n\nGranite Bluff itself is built as a sort of hybrid city, with a large classic underground complex, combined with an equally large aboveground human-style city.  The aboveground city is massively fortified, and has been repeatedly attacked by orcish armies that manage to penetrate past the Fortress of Light and the related border forts nearer the Blighted Gap.  The aboveground city has been captured and sacked twice, by armies that then fell to dwarven armies defending the undercity."
