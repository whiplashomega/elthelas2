  "description": "Ochre'ken is a relatively minor port city on the southern coast of Malinval.  Largely a resupply point for merchants headed further north and east, and a center of trade for the sparsely populated region of southwest Malinval.\n\n The city was attacked by demons in 1845, but managed to repulse the initial attacks, nevertheless the local population suffered significant losses due to the attack."
