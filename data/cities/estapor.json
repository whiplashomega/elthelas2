  "description": "Estapor is the capitol of the new elven nation of Waelin.  It also manages to extract a fair amount of wealth from the trade on the Sindi Silmeranna. With the independence of Waelin, this city has catapulted into new importance with an influx of people seeking to curry favor with the new Queen."
