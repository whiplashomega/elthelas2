  "description": "Estapor is the center of government for the continental Waelin region of Eldoran.  It also manages to extract a fair amount of wealth from the trade on the Sindi Silmeranna.  The Waelin government centered in Estapor is more a beauracratic center than a true decision making apparatus.  The beauracracy oversees the enactment of the decisions made by the central government in Loridesa, but makes few real decisions of its own."
