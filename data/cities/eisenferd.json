  "description": "Eisenferd as a town is a relatively minor city in Gerasalim. It serves as a hub for Gerasaline mining operations in the Sword Mountains, but it has traditionally been far removed from the centers of power, and it's population has traditionally fluctuated seasonally, as the miners would come down and stay in the city during the winter months, to return to their normal operations during the warmer seasons. Today Eisenferd serves as the home of the queen in exile from her own capitol, and she has put great effort into fortifying this last redoubt of Gerasaline power."
