  "description": "New Morrind as a city is an expriment by the Morrind and the Republic of Curinor to reunite the dwarves. The Republic, not particularly interested in shipping interests anyway, offered control of the port town at the mouth of the Rock River to the Morrind, but with the city also subject to Curinor law, and with duty free trade between the city and the rest of Curinor. While there occasionally have been disputes, the biggest issue with the experiment has been the unwillingness of the leading classes of Curinor to move to a location so far from the mountains. The city has been dominated by the Morrind as a result, with most of the native Curinor dwarves being poor farmers and tradesmen. Nevertheless it has been a good result for Curinor, as it opened up the interior of the country to efficient trade, helping the country become more self-sufficient in terms of food production and other agricultural products."
