  "description": "Strovenguard, like Gerasalim as a whole, has undertaken the slow road to recovery after the Great War. The strangest difference is probably the large population of newly liberated, once enslaved goblins who now call the city home. Nevertheless, resources are few, and the manpower of Gerasalim has been stretched to the breaking point. It will take many years before the grand borderland kingdom is able to defend itself without aid."
