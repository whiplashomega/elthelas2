  "description": "Weizenland is the central hub in Gerasalim for farming and food production in the central plains of Gerasalim. It is a city as unremarkable as it is strategically important. Nevertheless the city has never been fortified beyond a simple log pallisade, and the retreating armies of Gerasalim stopped in Weizenland only long enough to strip the granaries and move on into the more easily fortified hills to the northeast. When the orcs came just days later the city was defenseless."
