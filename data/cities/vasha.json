  "description": "Vasha is the northern city of the bifurcated capitol of Dera'Dragorim.  Vasha is the poorer of the two cities, with most of the government offices and the Temple of Bahamut both being in Vashna instead. Vasha does have the bardic and wizards college, as well as the foundries and the Planar Quarter, where the tieflings, fey'ri, and genasi populations in the city tend to congregate.  Vasha is a highly cosmopolitan city, and you can see people of just about every race and type walking the streets."
