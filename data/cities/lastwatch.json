  "description": "Last Watch is a trading post in all things extraplanar and exotic. As the northernmost bastion of civilization in Zelfir, and the northernmost navigable port on the Red River, it does a lively trade. Meanwhile it houses a surprisingly large library and university for those dedicated to studying the strange artifacts and creatures that come through."
