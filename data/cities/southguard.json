  "description": "The fortress city of Southguard has for generations been the front line of Gerasalim's defenses against the Orcs along the blighted gap. After the fall of the Fortress of Light it was here that the Gerasaline army dug in to defend their homeland, and after weeks of grueling fighting, were smashed by the orcish juggernaut and forced to retreat to the capitol. Today the walls sit half in rubble, as the dejected residents serve as slaves to orc masters."
