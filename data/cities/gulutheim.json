  "description": "  Gulutheim is a sprawling, and largely lawless, port city on the southern coast of <a href='/geo/nations/malinval'>Malinval</a>. It's coast is largely protected from the rages of the oceans by the Isle of Peaks.  The local garrison is typically small, just enough to protect the interests of the warlord while the bulk of the armies fight the Alliance of 6 Nations to the north, and fend off any raids by the tribes on the Isle of Peaks.\n\nThe city was recently attacked by demons, leaving much of the city a burned out wreck and cutting the population to about 1/3 of its former size."
