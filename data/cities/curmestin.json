  "description": "Cur'Mestin is the westernmost city in Dormania, the small city acts as the center for the timber industry in western Dormania and eastern Kandor. Originally built as a forward staging base when Dorman I was planning his invasion of Kandor, the city continued to grow long after the war was over. The walls and castle have been restored in recent years, turning it into a formidable fortress city."
