  "description": "South Port is a minor city in Southern Dormania, often forgotten by those who seek grand and interesting places.  However it's position at the apex of the Dormanian Peninsula in warm waters makes it an important strategic position militarily and a common resupply point for traders making their way from the South Sea to ports in the Eastern Ocean and Ice Ocean."
