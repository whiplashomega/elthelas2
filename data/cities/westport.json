  "description": "Westport is the only port in Kandor open year-round, and so even though it does not sit on a major river like Kaland does, it serves as a major center for trade, particularly in the winter months. The Duke of Westport is second only to the King in terms of power in Kandor, and the King goes against the Duke at his own risk. Westport as a city is highly unusual for a human city, with it's large dwarven and half-dwarven minority population. The dwarves have built extensively under the primary city, giving Westport the unusual nickname of the Onion City, because it is a city with layers upon layers."
