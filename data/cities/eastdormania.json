  "description": "East Dormania was the first major city ever conquered by Dorman I, and when the city state Desadorel was renamed to the Empire of Dormania in his honor the city was renamed as well.  Today it is less important than it once was, but stands as the gateway to the capital from the southeastern part of the empire."
