  "description": "Like the rest of Stagenheim the gnomes of Gnoma are several hundred years beyond the rest of the world in technological progress, particularly in magical devices.\n\nGnoma, unlike Craftheim, focuses more on producing goods for trade than technological experimentation. This means that things tend to be more stable in Gnoma, and people have more wealth."
