  "description": "Diya is a hub of the plantation economy of Olda, full of factories refining sugar and turning much of it into rum or molases, and others turning cotton into cloth.\n\nThe city itself is a sprawling mess, with no strong government.  Powerful families of High Orcs build their factories and slave quarters in bunches, turning the city into what is more like a sprawling mass of towns of various sizes.  The duties of the city guard are farmed out to the retainers of the powerful families, and a wanted man with one family might receive protection from another."
