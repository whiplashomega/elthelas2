  "description": "Mithrin has been the center of dwarven operations in the Mithril Hills for the last 300 years. It is a true, fortified dwarven hold, built deep into the hills. It withstood a year long elven siege in the last Mithril War, holding the line against invasion even while the surrounding minor holds were slaughtered to the man. Today the city is a strange confluence of elven and dwarven influences. About 60% of the population remains dwarves who live below ground, but the official seat of government sits above ground, where the two provincial governors, one elf and one dwarf, share space in a single palace."
