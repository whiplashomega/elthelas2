  "description": "Tenecha, as the capitol of Terron, is the crown jewel of the nation. Nevertheless, once you leave the market centers and palaces the slums quickly dominate in this highly stratified city. The wealthy of the city have grown rich running cotton and sugar plantations while the common folk work for pennies on their land or in the mills. Tenecha itself sits on a series of terraced hills coming down from the mountains, with two fast flowing non-navigable rivers. Both of these rivers are utilized extensively for their water power by the cotton mills."
