  "description": "Swava is an imposing fortified fortress city. It stands as the beacon of elven and human power on the island. It has withstood hundreds of assaults, and the walls have been breached dozens of times only to be rebuilt taller and stronger. It is a testament to the resilience of the Shendaren people that the city exists and thrives."
