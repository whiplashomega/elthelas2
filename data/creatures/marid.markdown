***Amphibious.*** The marid can breath air and water.

***Elemental Demise.*** If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit witn spell attacks) . It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
At will: create or destroy water, detect evil and good, detect magic, fog cloud, purify food and drink  
3/day each: tongues, water breathing, water walk  
1/day each: conjure elemental (water elemental only), control water, gaseous form, invisibility, plane shift  

**Actions** 

***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks.

***Trident.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage, or 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Water jet.*** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked prone.
