**Spellcasting:** Haera has the following spell slots: 4 1st level, 3 2nd level, 3 3rd level, 3 4th level, 2 5th level, 1 6th level.

**Song of Rest:** Haera can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize her wounded allies during a short rest. If her or any friendly creatures who can hear her performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d8 hit points.

**Actions** 

**Countercharm:** Haera has the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, she can start a performance that lasts until the end of her next turn. During that time, her and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of her have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear her to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if she is incapacitated or silenced or if she voluntarily ends it (no action required).

**Bardic Inspiration:** Haera can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, she uses a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than herself within 60 feet of her who can hear her. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d10.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw it makes, or as a reaction add it to its AC. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

**Sheleleigh:** +9 (1d8+5 magical bludgeoning)
