***Brute.*** When the trollkin elite hits with a melee weapon attack it adds one extra die of the weapons damage to the attack. This is already included in its battleaxe attack listed below.

***Duelist*** Butch adds +2 damage to weapon attacks when weilding only 1 one-handed weapon.

***War Caster*** Butch can perform the somatic components of spells while weilding a weapon in each hand, and has advantage on saves to continue concentrating on spells. When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from Butch, she can cast a spell as a reaction rather than making an opportunity attack as long as the spell targets only that creature.

***War Magic*** When Butch casts a cantrip as an action on her turn she can make a weapon attack as a bonus action.

***Mobile*** When Butch makes a melee attack against a creature she does not provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn. When she uses the dash action difficult terrain costs no extra movement on her turn.
