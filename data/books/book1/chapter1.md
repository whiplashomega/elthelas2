## Chapter 1: Recruits

### Part 1: Vanriel

The fortress loomed. She knew she technically was still miles away from the massive complex known as the Fortress of Light, but it's huge 400 ft high walls were imposing even from this distance. They seemed to go on forever. Not just up, these walls stretched for over a mile on a side, the massive hexagonal fortress studded with towers, forward bullwarks stood outside the walls that dropped steeply into a moat of sharpened spikes. Beyond the spikes a vast field of empty ground, barren and lifeless, stretched all the way to where Vanriel stood and far beyond, out to the horizon, all life extinguished from the area by generations of brutal war. Facetted glowing crystals at least a span in length hovered over each tower, illuminating the fortress amidst the gloom of early dawn. High above the center of the fortress, another crystal, this one at least as tall as a man, rotated gently, glowing like a second sun.

The caravan Vanriel had travelled here with was packing up behind her, preparing for the final march to the fortress gates. Along with Vanriel and a handful of other recruits for the armies that called the fortress home, the caravan carried food and supplies, contracted by military suppliers back in Granite Bluff. The caravan leader, a grumpy old gnomish merchant who barely reached Vanriel's waist was busily ordering people about, his silk robes picking up dust from the hard ground.

She fell into line with the other recruits, mostly skinny underfed farmers kids like herself, as they trudged across the dusty ground between last nights camp and the large caravan gate on the north side of the fortress. She was a rare case among the recruits, owning her own bow. 

Her parents were game hunters near Moon Pass, and she had learned to hunt and shoot when she was barely ten. Unfortunately for her family, while the steady growth of the nearby trade town had supplied ample customers for the hides and meat they acquired, it had also gradually depleted the nearby woods of game. Then her mother had fallen ill, and the local cleric of Sylvan had charged an exhorbitant sum to cure her, most of a seasons take. 

So Vanriel left, visited the local recruitment office for the Black Wolf Irregulars, a high power mercenary company that payed well. Unfortunately they were also known for taking high-risk high-reward jobs, such as reinforcing a massive fortress in the middle of nowhere that was under near constant attack right before an army that might just be big enough to overrun it marched north.

The column came to a halt just outside the entrance as a group of dwarves in thick chain mail poked their heads into wagons and interrogated the caravan leader, thick steel shields hung off their backs, and brutal looking war axes hung from their belts. Their tabbards bore the hammer crest of Curinor.

Technically Eldoran, Vanriel's home country, and Curinor were allies, but it hadn't been long since that alliance was struck, and it had come after milenia of off-and-on wars and near constant bad blood. It was practically folk wisdom that putting a back country elf like Vanriel and a dwarf in the same room was likely to end with a fist fight or worse. Probably worse given than separating a dwarf from their axe was basically an act of suicide.

Nevertheless, the gate guards gave her little more than a passing glance and a sneer before waving the caravan through. She supposed she would have bigger worries in the coming weeks than a few grumpy dwarves upset at being forced out of their mines.

As they moved through the gate one of the guards directed them to a squat stone building. The wolf crest of the Irregulars swung on a wooden post outside the door. Once inside a halfling wearing spectacles was pouring over a list of names. Her hairy feet swinging nearly a foot off the floor.

"Name?" The tiny functionary said to the lead recruit.

"Galen, no family name if it pleases you." the man replied in flawless Imperial. He seemed even skinnier than the other recruits, if it could be believed, his sandy blonde hair struggling to hide the pointed ears beneath. A half-elf if Vanriel had to guess. Back in Eldoran half-blood stock such as him would have been a subject of scorn.

"Place of recruitment?"

"Strovenguard, Gerasalim." Half-elves like him were common enough in southwest Gerasalim that combined with his flawless Imperial the answer was really a foregone conclusion, but Vanriel was glad of the confirmation anyway.

"Squad 6, stand over there please." Galen stood over by the wall the functionary had indicated, examining a rather poorly made tapestry that hung there.

"Name?" The functionary addressed the next recruit. He was clearly human, probably also Gerasaline given his pale skin and blonde hair. A tall gangly kid in rough clothes.

"Erwin Godel"

"Place of recruitment?"

"Eastguard, Gerasalim"

"Squad 4, over there please." The woman pointed to the opposite wall from Galen, on the right side of the room. The kid awkwardly went over there, where a glass case held a gleaming sword. A small plaque noted that the sword had once been wielded by Gowry the Magnificent. Vanriel had no idea who that was, probably some adventurer who had made a name for themselves.

The functionary turned to her. "Name?"

"Vanriel Glamfara, recruited in Storvel, Eldoran ma'am" she replied, picking up on the cadence of the questions.

Nevertheless the functionary quickly followed along in her existing train of thought. "Place of recruitment?"

"I just said Storvel, ma'am". Vanriel repeated, feeling a little cross at having to repeat herself when the woman had clearly heard her the first time.

"Don't talk back to superior officers. Squad 6, please stand over there." The woman replied, pointing to where Galen already stood, now clearly done examining the tapestry.

"So what are you in for?" Galen asked her as she walked over.

"None of your business half-breed," she replied, probaby more than a little too flippantly. The functionary was already questioning the next recruit in line. Vanriel tried to ignore it, as well as the clearly off-put half-elf next to her, she did notice while several more people were added to Squad 5, as well as Squads 3 and 4, no one else was added to Squad 6.

Her keen elfin eyes perked up when the last recruit came through the door however. They were wearing a heavy cloak with the hood draped over their face, and a mask over their mouth. This person had not been with their caravan. They were clearly taller and more muscular than anyone else in line, and despite the heat not a single bit of skin was clearly showing.

The functionary didn't even look up as they continued. "Name?"

"Alkea." A deep female voice responded. The functionary looked up, finally noticing the shear size of the recruit, and the covering clothing.

"Show your face recruit." The woman dropped the hood, and before she could reach up to remove her mask the sound of swords leaving sheaths filled the room. Vanriel instinctively reached for her bow. The mask dropped, revealing the unmistakable small tusks of an orc woman.
