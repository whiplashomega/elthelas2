  <p>
    Made a big update to the geography page, as clicking on a marker, instead of loading the data in the sidebar, now loads the location
    description into a lightbox.  This also means that the map can now cover the full page width!

    I've also slowly continued adding city descriptions, and expect location maps, such as city and nation maps, to start popping up in
    the near future.
