    Made updates to the Factotum class.  It now has 3 philosophy choices, and has been reasonably well tested for balance.  Scourer's have been
    introduced as well, but still need play testing.  I also have listed proposed changes for the Ranger and Barbarian classes that should help
    those classes balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Factotum is meant to be a class decent at everything and great at nothing.  It can cast spells from any list, but has a very limited
    number of spells per day, that cost a lot of resources to cast.  Scourers are by contrast a very focused fighting class that specializes in
    fighting spellcasters.

    Rangers and barbarians (particularly Rangers) were the clear losers in the rebalancing for 5th edition.  While druids took a hard nerf
    to the face, they went from godlike to good.  Rangers went from mediocre to bad, and barbarians went from good to mediocre.  I made some
    small changes to ranger and barbarian, particularly focusing on increasing damage output.  Beastmaster's animal companion should no longer
    be worthless, and rage bonus damage is now more than an afterthought.  Similarly favored enemy now provides a small amount of bonus damage
    that should keep the class feature from being completely worthless flavor text.
