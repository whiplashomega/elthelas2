  "description": "The Blood Brothers is an organization of military veterans, ex-bandits, and adventurers who couldn't give up fighting or wanted a more profitable way of doing so. They live for the thrill of the fight, and started a mercenary organization so they could keep doing so and get paid. The blood brothers will take just about anyone as a client, but won't fight other members of the Brotherhood. Unlike the Black Wolf Irregulars or the Trollkin Mercenary Corp, the Blood Brothers focus on small jobs, such as delving a dangerous dungeon for some artifact, assassinating a rival, or hunting down an escaped convict.",
