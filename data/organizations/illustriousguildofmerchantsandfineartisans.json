  "description": "Based in [Desadorel](/geo/cities/desadorel) and spread throughout the imperial nations of [Gerasalim](/geo/nations/gerasalim), [Kandor](/geo/nations/kandor), and [Dormania](/geo/nations/dormania), members of the Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans controls most of the trade throughout the region. Operating a trading company without the blessing of the guild is generally considered to be unhealthy, often leading to premature death by such diverse means as poison, stabbing, falling from very high places, and lynching.\n\nMeanwhile, membership in the guild provides access to discounts on hiring guards, grants your voice greater weight in matters of local governance, and a certain amount of protection from unwanted competitors, unless of course those competitors are also guild members.",
