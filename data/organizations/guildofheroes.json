  "description": "The Guild of Heroes is dedicated to hunting down and destroying monstrous creatures, for payment of course.  They pride themselves on taking the jobs that the normal authorities can't handle.  They are strictly non-political and don't get involved in conflicts between humanoid peoples, and as a result are welcome in most nations.",
