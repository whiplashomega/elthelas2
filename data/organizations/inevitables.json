  "description": "The Inevitables are a group of bounty hunters that emulate the true Inevitables, immortal machines created by Tock to hunt those who break their oaths, or seek to destroy the most basic tenets of order in the universe, like mortality and the immutability of time. The lowest ranks of the Inevitables serve as thief takers, hunting those who have broken the law on behalf of local authorities, the upper echelons of the society seek greater prey however. Creatures that seek to break the bonds of mortality, such as a lich, or mortals that seek to ascend to godhood face the wrath of the mortal inevitables.",
