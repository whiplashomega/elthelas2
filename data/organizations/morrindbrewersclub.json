  "description": "The [Morrind](/geo/nations/morrindim), like their kin from [Curinor](/geo/nations/curinor), love beer and brewing. Unlike their kin from [Curinor](/geo/nations/curinor), they have access to a variety of ingredients unlike any other group in the world. Some years back, a group of prominent brewers from a variety of colonies got together and began trading recipes. Soon they formed an organization, admittance to which required the submission of a high quality recipe (judged by the local guild members). It caught on like wildfire, and now the world over it is known that the place to get the best beer is the local Morrind Brewers Club.",
