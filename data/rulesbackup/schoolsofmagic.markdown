Schools of Magic
<h4>Abjuration</h4>
<p>
  Abjuration is the use of the arcane or divine force to create barriers. This includes creating and restoring the barriers between the planes, which includes banishment effects.  Dispelling effects and anti-magic fields are fields that remove or dampen the effects of arcanum or the divine spark, usually by creating a barrier that emits the dampening force that moves outward.
</p>
<h4>Conjuration</h4>
<p>
  Conjuration magic is the use of one of the forces to pierce the planar barriers and, usually, bring something across the gap. This can be anything from energy (such as in an orb of fire spell) to a living creature, to small amounts of divine force (such as in healing spells).
</p>
<h4>Divination</h4>
<p>
  Divination magic is the use of the forces to transmit energy over great distances, the energy transmitted can usually only be very small, and thus it is typically used for observational purposes.
</p>
<h4>Enchantment</h4>
<p>
  Enchantment is the use of the forces to manipulate the minds of others.  This is a delicate and difficult process, and often can only be done in broad strokes.  However, most good societies consider the use of enchantment magic on unwilling individuals to be a violation of personal freedom, and additionally it can leave lasting, and sometimes unpredictable, side effects.
</p>
<h4>Evocation</h4>
<p>
  Evocation is the direct application of arcane or divine force, sometimes to create other energy effects, and sometimes to simply apply force directly.
</p>
<h4>Illusion</h4>
<p>
  Illusion is the use of arcane or divine force to manipulate sound waves, light, and sometimes even smell.  It is a school that often requires a great deal of skill and finesse, but not necessarily a lot of power.
</p>
<h4>Necromancy</h4>
<p>
  Necromancy is an attempt to transfer the divine force from one creature to another, to animate non-living creatures, or tap directly into the positive and negative energy planes.
</p>
<h4>Transmutation</h4>
<p>
  Transmutation is the use of arcane or divine force to actively alter physical forms or infuse them with energy.  It is usually a temporary effect as it is very difficult to overcome a living objects morphic resonance (a manifestation of the divine force that remembers a natural form, this is why healing spells infuse a person with a small amount of additional divine force, it strengthens their morphic resonance allowing them to heal faster).
