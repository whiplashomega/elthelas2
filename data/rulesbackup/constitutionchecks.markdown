Constitution Checks
<p>
  Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

<p>
  The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hold your breath</li>
  <li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
  <li>Go without sleep</li>
  <li>Survive without food or water</li>
  <li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
</ul>
