GM Rules
Madness
Madness
<p>
  In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.

<h4>Going Mad</h4>
<p>
  Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can a lso break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.

<p>
  Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score , a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.

<h4>Madness Effects</h4>
<p>
  Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in longterm or indefinite madness.
</p>
<h4>Curing Madness</h4>
<p>
  A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
