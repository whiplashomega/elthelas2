Group Ability Checks

<p>
  Ability checks that require everyone to succeed to be a success (such as moving stealthily as a group) are made by averaging the result. So everyone in the party rolls their dice, adds their modifiers, and then the results are averaged to determine if the group succeeds or fails.

<p>
  Ability checks that require one person in the group to succeed for the whole group to succeed should be rolled by at most two characters, or one character assisted by another character (see the Help action).
