First Aid
<p>
  You can use an action to apply first aid to a character. To do so, make a DC 15 wisdom (medicine) check. On a success you restore 1 hit point to the creature. If you have a healers kit you are proficient with you can expend one use of the healers kit to gain advantage on the check and restore 2d4+2 hit points on a success.
