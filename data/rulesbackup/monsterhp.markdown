Hit Points
<p>
  A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.
</p>
<p>
  A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. A monsters hit points are their hit die size + the average roll of their hit dice + its consitution modifier * the number of hit dice. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit dice and a con mod of 2 would have has 21 hit points on average (8 + 2 * 4Â½ + 2 * 2).
</p>
<p>
  A monster's size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.
