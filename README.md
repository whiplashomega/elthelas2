# Elthelas Campaign Setting
My Elthelas Campaign Setting website rebuilt on the MEAN stack.  This is my personal side-project for learning new concepts and ideas, and so has taken various forms over its life.  In an effort to save hard-drive space I have rebased from this repo: https://github.com/whiplashomega/elthelas
which hosts my older Symfony based version of the site, as well as an earlier version of this code from when I was still planning to use Symfony as
the API backend for this code.  Symfony proved to be frustrating to work with from a headless standpoint, particularly in implementing user login and handling server routing.

## Branches
Production releases are tracked on the 'production' branch.  
Code ready for final testing should be on UAT branch  
Current master development is on the 1.x-dev branch.

Updates that do not require significant testing (such as introducing new content) are done on the master branch.

New features and significant code changes are done on the 2.0dev branch, when a new feature is ready it is merged into master and production.
