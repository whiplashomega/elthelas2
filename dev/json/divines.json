Since the Gods War, Asmodeus has never again taken such an aggressive stance towards the world, his lawful nature forcing him to be bound to the agreement he made at the end of the war. Instead he seeks to gain souls and influence for his kingdom by making deals with other beings.

He takes the appearance of a massive slug, with tiny half-formed arms and eye stalks that move independently, watching all around him.  Baalzebul originally was a Solar in the service of Cora, who zealously took his war to the nine hells, arrogantly believing he could best Asmodeous himself, before falling to it's corrupting influence.  His arrogance remained even after his first transformation to a devil, and he betrayed Asmodeous soon after rising to rule his layer of Hell.

He is involved with everything from starting rebellions to unpredictable natural disasters such as earthquakes. He is often reviled by the leaders of the more law-bent churches, such as those worshipping Alohim, Bahamut, Dorman, or even Mat'raktha, as many tales tell of how he has dashed the well laid plans of these Gods quests for order through power.\n\nA common way to curse someone is to give them the sign of Bartholomew, a drawing combining the holy symbols of the 3 Gods he serves, a banner all but consumed in flames over a compass rose of arrows."},{"id":"belial","name":"Belial","alignment":"Lawful Evil","home":"Nine Hells","type":"Fiend","description":"Belial, Lord of Rape, Deposed Lord of the Fourth Layer of Hell, still maintains the power of a Duke of Hell, having willingly stepped down from his post in favor of his daughter Fierna.

'Me' could probably best be described as a sentient living plane (or potentially demi-plane) of existence. The existence of 'Me' is only known about due to a few magical accidents in which wizards of one sort or another found themselves on the plane of 'Me'. It isn't in fact clear if there is just one such plane, or if perhaps there are many. The name 'Me' stems mostly, it seems, from not having a name, or really understanding the concept of names, while still having an individual identity. The plane, when asked who it is, has been known to express confusion and repeat the statement, \"I am me.\"\n\nThe being was recently revealed to be the trapped Goddess Area, who refused the terms of the Gods Agreement and was thus imprisoned by the other Gods, stripped of form and trapped on a demiplane.  She briefly returned to the world only to be slain by the dagger of Nera, famed to be able to kill even a God.

Nevertheless he constantly schemes to undermine Asmodeous.  Why Asmodeous hasn't cast Mephistopheles down, as he did other Archdevils who rebelled against him, is one of the great mysteries of the Nine Hells.  Perhaps it is because his hate for Asmodeous is only matched by his hate for Baalzebul, and thus Asmodeous can play the two Dukes against each other, securing his own position with little true effort."},{"id":"mikael","name":"Mikael","alignment":"Chaotic Evil","home":"Carceri","type":"Fiend","description":"The Angel of Vengeance is more demon than angel.
