[{"date":"-480","title":"Curin Keep Construction","shortDesc":"construction begins on Curin Keep.","description":"The dwarves found themselves fragmented and surrounded by enemies at the end of the God's War, with most groups being killed off relatively early.  One of the major groups that survived was led by a dwarf named Curin Highhammer.  It was about 15 years after the end of the war that Curin proposed an end to searching for their kin, and that the dwarves put down roots and build a proper hold and temple to Dorun, where they could seek the aid of their patron God.  Legend has it that as he made the pronouncement, he struck the ground with his pick, and the rock face in front of him fell away revealing a massive vein of pure gold, and in that spot the dwarves began the delvings that would become known as Curin Keep.\n"},{"date":"-500","title":"God's War","shortDesc":"The Gods' Agreement brings an end to the God's War.","description":"The God's War refers to a period of unknown length before recorded history in which the Gods walked Elthelas freely among their greatest creation and \nservants, the Sorceron. Sorceron magi, wizards. Theologians (at least outside of groups that worship Mat'raktha) blame the war on a coup by Mat'raktha \nin which he sought to claim the world for himself. Malik, the God of Chaos and War joined his coup because he thought it interesting, and they further \nallied themselves with the forces of the hells and the abyss. If true it is in fact the only time that any of these factions have actively aided one \nanother. Certain apographal theologians claim that the war was actually started by Alohim in a quest to rid the world of all evil influences, but such \nideas are frowned upon. This unholy alliance took the other Gods by surprise and the war raged continuously until nearly every Sorceron alive was dead, \nas well as many angels, archangels, powerful demons and devils, and even several minor Gods.\n\nThe war finally ended with Mat'raktha banned from intervening in the world except through mortal clerics after Malik agreed to withdraw from the war. \nWhat Malik got in return for this betrayal is unknown, but perhaps he saw an end to all future chaos and wars with the potential destruction of all \nmortal races. Despite all of this it was Nera, the goddess of Death and Rebirth, who refused to take a side in the war, who ensured that the God's \nWar would not happen again. She used her power to declare death to any God who walked the world himself with no hope of Rebirth.\n"},{"date":"-488","title":"Loridesa Constructed","shortDesc":"Loridesa, the world's oldest surviving city is constructed.","description":"The elves came out of the God's War better off than most other races thanks to the protection of Sylvan.  Their population was concentrated in the southwest of the Eldoran subcontinent.  As they began to encounter threats from other races in the area they decided to form a single central government.  A council of elder druids came together and settled on the creation of a single central city and appealed to Sylvan to choose a ruler for the elves.  That city was Loridesa.\n"}]
