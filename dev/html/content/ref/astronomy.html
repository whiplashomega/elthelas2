		Elthelas has three moons, one of which is much larger than the other two.  The largest moon, (called Ara, after the Ocean Queen)
		is in tidal lock with the planet, the same face always faces Elthelas as it orbits.  It takes 32 days for it to complete an orbit of the planet.
		The smallest moon is Aruru, named for the messenger archangel and lesser divine.  Aruru is both close to the planet, and orbits contrary to the direction of planetary
		rotation, meaning it appears to shoot across the sky, relatively speaking.  Aruru completes it's phases in 8 days.  The last moon, Dina, is named for the
		Archangel of Lore and Knowledge.  Dina is technically a moon of Ara, and as such is hidden from view a large portion of the time.

		The relationship and interactions between the three moons as they travel across the sky is a common focus of omens and astrologers.  For example, when Dina and Aruru are
		close to each other is supposed to be a good time to seek knowledge.
