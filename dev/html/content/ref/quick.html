        <h3>Quick Reference Manual</h3>
        <p>
          The quick reference manual provides a rules reference for things that would normally be found in tables and lists in the PHB.  This reference provides an online searchable
          interface for these items.  The weapons, armor, labor and services, animals, and trade goods tabs use values for costs and prices that attempt to put together a more
          coherent economy for D&D, where laborers can afford to do things like eat.
