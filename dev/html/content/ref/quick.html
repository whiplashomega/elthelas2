        <h3>Quick Reference Manual</h3>
        <p>
          The quick reference manual provides a rules reference for things that would normally be found in tables and lists in the PHB.  This reference provides an online searchable
          interface for these items.  The weapons, armor, labor and services, animals, and trade goods tabs use values for costs and prices that attempt to put together a more
          coherent economy for D&D, where laborers can afford to do things like eat.

            <h3>Armor</h3>
            <p>
              When ordering custom weapons and armor, the 'time cost' refers to the time required by 1 artisan to do the work by himself.  For most complex items, up to 12 workers may work on an item per day (4 working together in 3 shifts), additionally the presence of a master craftsmen allows the work to be completed in half the time.  Thus the minimum time required to create an item by a master craftsmans guild shop is 1/24 the listed time requirement, or changes the unit from days to hours.

            <h3>Weapons</h3>
            <p>
              When ordering custom weapons and armor, the 'time cost' refers to the time required by 1 artisan to do the work by himself.  For most complex items, up to 12 workers may work on an item per day (4 working together in 3 shifts), additionally the presence of a master craftsmen allows the work to be completed in half the time.  Thus the minimum time required to create an item by a master craftsmans guild shop is 1/24 the listed time requirement, or changes the unit from days to hours.

While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</td>
