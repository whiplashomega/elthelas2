  <h1>Fantastic Materials</h1>
  <p>Elthelas, like any fantasy setting, is filled with materials and substances that defy the imagination.  The list below is not exhaustive, but should give you an idea of some of the things you can expect to find in Elthelas.</p>
  <h3>Metals and Minerals</h3>
  <h4>Adamantine</h4>
  <p>
    The unbreakable ore, Adamantine has remarkable tensile strength that makes it nearly impossible to break or dent at normal temperatures. Found deep in the earth and primarily only mined in Stagenheim and Curinor, it is incredibly expensive on the open market, but armor made from it is without peer.
  </p>
  <h4>Arcanum</h4>
  <p>
    Arcanum is a naturally ocurring, self-attracting crystal. It is the source of Arcane magic, exerting forces on the fabric of the universe that can be manipulated with concentrated conscious thought. Sorcerers and bards have Arcanum crystal in their blood, while Wizards use a concentrated source, such as a gem, to focus their magic.
  </p>
  <h4>Mithril</h4>
  <p>
    Mithril is light, strong, and flexible, making it an incredibly useful metal for all kinds of purposes. It would be more so if it weren't so rare. With the worlds largest deposits found in the hotly contested (and barely mined) Mithril Hills, finding Mithril on the open market is difficult at best.
  </p>
  <h4>Orichalcum</h4>
  <p>
    Orichalcum is a unique and difficult to create alloy of Chromium, Tungsten, and Iron smelted and forged at incredibly hot temperatures and free of almost any impurity. Once cooled it holds its shape better than any other known material on Elthelas. While it is more breakable than adamantine, and heavier than ordinary steel, this irridescent blue metal is excellent at deflecting blunt force, or for making components that must stand up to high heat.
  </p>
  <h4>Parakas Steel</h4>
  <p>
    Made from the blood red iron sands of the Rust Desert, Parakas Steel has a dintictive reddish color that is as imposing as the armor made from it is practical.  Parakas steel is much more pliable than ordinary steel, bending under pressure without breaking and then snapping back to its original shape. It takes a great deal of force to mold or pierce it, making armor made from it particularly useful against stabbing weapons.
