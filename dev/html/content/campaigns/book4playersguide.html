  </p>
  <h3>The State of the World</h3>
<p><strong>Gerasalim is in Flames</strong>. The Fortress of Light has fallen, Strovenguard is an occupied city, Eastguard has been reduced to rubble, and Northport is under imminent threat.  The last of the Gerasaline armies have retreated to the Sword Mountains, attacking the orc armies from caves and hidden strong points. </p>

<p><strong>The Moon Elves are nearly extinct</strong>.  After 2 years of being hunted in their homeland their numbers have been reduced to a few thousand refugees who have fled into Eldoran, Curinor, and Gerasalim.</p>

<p><strong>The Dwarves have retreated to their holds</strong>.  No major hold has ever fallen to a foreign invader, and the Dwarves have withdrawn their armies to wait out the crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Eldoran is in civil war</strong>.  The sudden extinction of the royal line and the ascension of the relatively incompetent Derandel to the throne left a massive power vacuum that various local lords have risen to fill.  Only the Waelin region on continental Elathia still fights against the Orcs, now desperate for reinforcements as Orc armies march directly on their borders.</p>


<p><strong>Kandor faces invasion</strong>.  The Orcs are now on the unfortified southern border of Kandor, sending raids north while they attempt to deal with the remaining Gerasaline armies.</p>

<p><strong>Into this destruction Gerad Heartbren, last commander of the Black Wolf Irregulars, has put out one last desperate call for recruitment</strong>.  You have answered this call, for reasons of your own, and have travelled to the fortress of Curâ€™Estan in the woods of Kandor, where the he is gathering the forces that will make a last desperate stand against evil in Elathia.</p>  

<blockquote>
  <p class="alert alert-warning">This might change depending on the resolution of the previous campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Dormania has withdrawn from the Alliance</strong>. The ascension of Alexandra Ransomir as Dormana I, Empress of Dormania, brings new hope in the east, but her ascension is not uncontested. The slighted second place finisher, Manius Aquila, has raised his flag in rebellion, and the western duchies of Dormania have risen to support him. This has forced the new Empress to hold back the legions and fight a war on her own territory.</p>

    <h3>Starting Out</h3>
    <p>
      You will start as someone who, for whatever reason, has answered the call by Gerad Heartbren to gather at Cur'Estan to defeat the orcs.  You may be a true believer, a money-hungry opportunist, or a desparate refugee. You may be acting on the behest of a faction you belong to, or seeking revenge.  Whatever your reasons, you find yourself at the gates of the castle Cur'Estan, ready to wade into the fray of a war seemingly already lost.  You are the last great hope of Elthelas.

    <h4>Building Your Character</h4>
    <p>
      Players should use the following guidelines for building their characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1: Pick a Race</strong> <a ui-sref='app.races'>Use the race list on this site.</a>  Note that known languages have been removed from racial entries, languages known will be determined later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2: Determine Ability Scores</strong> You can choose between a 30 pt point buy (max 16) or roll 4d6 (pick 3) 6 times and then assign them to ability scores.  If you use a point buy, use the following table to determine the cost of any particular ability score (before racial adjustment):
    </p>
    <table class="table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Score</th><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Cost</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>12</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3: Choose a Class</strong> <a ui-sref='app.classes'>Use the class list on this site.</a> If the class or subclass details are not listed on the site they are available in the Players Handbook or the D&D supplement book listed on the page.  If you do not have access to a copy of the particular book talk to your DM.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4: Determine your background</strong> <a ui-sref='app.backgrounds'>You can use the background listing on the site.</a> Backgrounds can be custom built as well.  Talk to your DM if you would like to use a custom background.  Use the guidelines in the Player's Handbook for building any custom background.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5: Choose your Faction (optional)</strong> Players for this campaign are encouraged (but not required) to start as part of a major faction.  PCs will receive additional orders (and potentially rewards) from faction leaders as part of each major mission.  The faction likely shows up in the characters backstory, and the characters ideals and goals should be closely aligned with the faction they join.  The organizations provide various benefits to players in their adventuring career as well as upholding certain ideals called tenets.  See the <a href='app.organizations'>Organizations page</a> for details on the factions, and the list below for the organizations available as factions to join in this campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6: Detailed Character History </strong> Flesh out your characters history in relation to the events of the world with your DM.  You need to answer a few important questions at a minimum:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a ui-sref='app.geo'>Where are they from?</a></li>
      <li>They are starting the campaign at level 3, which means they have some history and skill already.  What have they done in the past?</li>
      <li>Where were they before the start of the campaign?</li>
      <li>Do they have family or friends somewhere that they care about? A previous adventuring party that is still out there somewhere?</li>
      <li>If you are a member of a faction, how did you join it, what is your standing in that organization?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7: Languages Known</strong> Determine what languages your character knows.  See the <a ui-sref='app.languages'>Languages page</a> for details on what and how many languages your character knows.  All PCs should know Imperial from some means, whether by being from a country that speaks it normally, or by getting it through a background, racial, or ability score based bonus language. <em>Imperial will be the lingua franca of the campaign, and not knowing it will be a major hindrance to your character.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8: Level up Your Character</strong> Your character should be level 3 at the start of the campaign, so level up your character appropriately according to your chosen class. Multiclassing may be allowed with DM approval, for the rules of multiclassing, see the Player's Handbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9: Choose your Equipment</strong> Ignore the equipment provided by your class.  In addition to the equipment provided by your background and potentially your faction, you start with 500 gp worth of equipment.  Players can use this to purchase armor, weapons, adventuring gear, mounts or common magic items (see the <a ui-sref="app.quickref">Quick Reference Manual</a> for listings and prices).
    </p>

      <h3 id="curestan">Cur'Estan</h3>
  <p class="row"><img src="/images/maps/curestan.png" alt="Map of Cur'Estan" class="col-sm-12" id="curestanmap" /></p>
  <p>Cur'Estan was once the fortress capitol of an ancient minor Kandori king, destroyed by Dorman I and left as a ruin in the woods.  20 years ago the Black Wolf Irregulars rebuilt the central castle to serve as their headquarters, and over the twenty years since a small town has sprung up around the castle serving the needs of the castle.  Over the last year, as the orcs have ravaged Demal'Thor, and then moved into Gerasalim, refugees have slowly trickled into the town.  A refugee camp has sprung up on the outskirts, now threatening to outnumber the original residents.</p>
  
  <p>The de facto ruler of Cur'Estan is General Gerad Heartbren of the Black Wolf Irregulars.  He commands the castle, and roughly 2000 soldiers, the last remains of the Black Wolf Irregulars forces.  </p>
  
  <p>The massive castle, with it's 30 ft thick walls, and 100 ft tall keep towers over the town in the west.  It contains large storehouses, stables, smiths, and fletchers who supply the soldiers.
  </p>
  <p>The town itself is dominated by the large stone embassy buildings, one for each of the Alliance nations, Kandor, Gerasalim, Dormania, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran.  Today only the Kandori Embassy is occupied, the rest have been abandoned, with only a caretaker cleaning crew assigned by Gerad to keep them from falling into disrepair.  The streets of the town are winding and haphazard.  The town was built quickly, with no particular plan, as merchants and tradesmen gravitated towards the town to fill the needs of the castle garrison and soldiers stationed there. The area directly in front of the castle gate is kept clear except in the mornings, when the merchants from the town, farmers, and hunters from the surrounding area set up temporary stands to sell goods.</p>
  <p>
    To the south of the castle is the barracks of the Black Wolf Irregulars, approximately 1500 soldiers stay in the barracks (in addition to the 500 or so garrisoned in the castle).  The area west of the barracks is used as a training ground.
  </p>
  <p>To the south of the town is the refugee camp, housing about 1000 refugees, managed by a contingent of Amathera's Shield, about 50 strong.  The refugees are welcome in town, and occasionally one will have the funds to build a proper house in the town itself, the rest are housed in large tents in the camp, each housing as many as 50 people.</p>
  <p>
    The southeast, between the town and the refugee camp, sits the permament complex of the Lords of the Rising Dawn.  An order of knights and paladins headquartered in Kaland.  The order has approximately 1000 soldiers garrisoned here in 4 large barracks buildings.
