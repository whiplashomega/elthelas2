## Player Characters

### Silas of Irons

**Player:** Mark Domaszek

**Organization:** Shepherds of the All-Mother

**Class:** Fighter (Eldritch Knight)

**Race:** Staelic Human

**Background:** Outlander

#### Backstory

Silas grew up with his mother in the mountains of Staelia. His mother was an evil witch and while she loved him dearly, her punishments were severe, and he bears many magical scars from his upbringing. He learned to fight from a minotaur companion of his mother, Tarik Spinehoof. Tarik watched over him growing up. Silas never knew his father and his mother almost never spoke of him.

Silas left home after coming of age “to seek his destiny” his mother would say. He drifted from place to place, never putting down roots. Always a survivor and scavenger, not one to leave behind what might be useful later. He found bounty hunting to be a natural talent for him. He was extremely physically gifted and could wrestle most anything down and drag it back to the garrison.

During his drifting he became close friends with Lilac Blossom. Blossom was a local Priestess of Amathera he met in Gerasalim. On one of Silas’s trips through the area Blossom was raped and murdered by a Lord-General of the Rising Dawn, Sir Erik Dawnblade. Afterward her spirit came to Silas saying she cannot rest while Dawnblade goes unpunished.

Sir Dawnblade was most recently stationed at the Fortress of Light, leading the Rising Dawn there.  Silas found a few survivors who escaped who say he disappeared just days before the Fortress fell to the orcs, and no one really knows where or why.  Silas has arrived in Cur'Estan hoping to find clues to his whereabouts among the other Lords of the Rising Dawn. Meanwhile, his mother's sendings have been... odd of late.  She has been known to wax prophetic from time to time, but she keeps talking about some halfling Sherriff and an Orc who plays bagpipes and how 'they will be pivotal in the events leading to the demise of your enemy'.  These sendings are always followed closely after by admonitions to change into clean underwear.

### Flykr Moon

**Player:** Morgan Charlton

**Organization:** Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans

**Class:** Bard (College of Glamour)

**Race:** Child of Molton

**Background:** ?

#### Backstory

Flykr Moon was born in Staelia. She is the third child of the local seamstress, Miriam Corneztra. Miriam’s husband Marius Corneztra died in an accident as he was traveling from Staelia to a nearby city. He was alone and it is still unknown what had caused the accident. Miriam, being a beautiful woman, was sought after by many suitors within the village, but no one seemed to catch her fancy. Until the mysterious stranger, Ta’Mahln Moon arrived. He was a member of the Church of Molton and sent to the village to find a wife and start mission for the church within the town. Miriam fell hard and fast for the handsome man, and he seemed to love her as much in return. After they were married, much to her children, Malick and Keera Corneztra’s, distress, the four moved into the house attached to the building that would become the Church of Molton. The two siblings felt something was off with the stranger and did not trust him. It wasn’t until after they were married that he told her he was unable to give her another child, and convinced her to go with him to the next town’s Church of Molton to pray to their God for help. Naturally, Molton was eager to help the two, taking Miriam back to his palace. A few days later, she returned to her home in Staelia, announcing to her husband and children she was pregnant. Thus, Flykr Moon came to be. 

Ta’Mahln and Miriam doted upon all three children, but it was clear Ta’Mahln loved Flykr above all others, including his own wife. Miriam did her best to be a fair and compassionate mother to all three. Her half-siblings, Malick and Keera, however, hated Ta’Mahln. Keera hated Flykr just as much. Malick, however, felt a need to protect his youngest sister. He was kind to her and often stood against Keera when she would go after Flykr in jealousy fueled rage. 

Despite being spoiled by her step-father and hated by her sister, Flykr grew to be a very kind, patient, friendly young woman. She was seen by many of the boys, and men, in her village as utterly beautiful. And by many of the girls, and some of the women, as devastatingly elegant. She made friends rather easily, but the same could be said about rivals and enemies as well. A young human boy, Silas (Mark’s character), was one being she counted as friend. He lived in the same village, just down the way from where she grew up. His mother was dear friends with Miriam, so the two kids knew each other rather well.

As she grew, Flykr’s affinity for performance arts, especially dance and rhythmic music, became more obvious. She seemed to be completely in tune with her body and her surroundings. It was as if she could feel the rhythm of the natural world around her and find the music to which she danced anywhere. Her father and mother both nurtured her natural abilities and talents, eventually enrolling her into dance and music classes as early as possible. When she was 13 years old, she met Gazelle, a famous dance instructor. Gazelle was stern and unrelenting in her teachings, but she was the best teacher Flykr could have ever asked for. She pushed Flykr harder than anyone else, because she knew the potential the Child of Molton had. 

Gazelle’s daughter, Jazelle, however, despised Flykr. Jazelle had been the outstanding student in the dance school before Flykr arrived, and was quickly replaced once Flykr’s passion was ignited fully. Jazelle declared to one day see Flykr loose her ability to capture everyone’s attentions and admirations. She was a jealous and angry woman.

Growing up as one of the few Children of Molton in a village like Staelia was always a struggle for Flykr. Sometimes it was hard to tell if a person, especially boys/men, truly enjoyed her company and liked her as the person she was, or if they were just infatuated with her appearance and racial reputation. She had many would-be suitors pounding on her family’s door when she was finally old enough to be courted. At first the idea of being so well desired was something she enjoyed, but soon, it became more taxing and upsetting than anything. More often than not, her suitors merely wished to sleep with her with the intention of having the best bar room scandal. She learned her lesson on that rather quickly.

But occasionally, she did find someone who truly wanted her. In some manner, anyway. A year before she left to attend the prestigious Bard College of Glamour, Flykr met Keiran Mikleson. He was desperately in love with her, to the point of becoming very controlling and overprotective. They only courted for a short time, but during that time, he tried to convince her to forget about dancing and becoming a Bard, for him. He tried to express that she would never be safe unless she was with him and when it became clear he could not manipulate her, and that she was going to leave him to go to the College, he hired a couple of men to scare her back to him. The men ambushed her in an alley, but were not prepared for what they found. It was never a well discussed fact. Ta’Mahln had taught his step-daughter how to wield daggers and a rapier for defense. And with her natural dexterity and grace, she was quite formidable with the weapons. She sent the men back to Keiran with a message that she would never go back to him and he should move on.  

At the Bard College of Glamour, Flykr met a Thomas Marcellus, a blind Elf who could spin the most amazing tales of love and romance. The two became dear friends, and are still in touch to this day. While she was at College, she met a kind Half Orc named Barbarious. Though he was a bit ill-suited as a Bard, he was still a decent being, and Flykr enjoyed his company. During their time together, Flykr began to realise Barbarious wasn’t happy at the College, he felt he didn’t quite fit in. And in truth, he didn’t. So Flykr did her best to help him come to terms with the idea that he didn’t want to be there and therefore shouldn’t be there. 

During her last year at the College, Flykr was approached by Carter Gold, an Elven merchant who recruited for the Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Artisans. It was known that Flykr was looking for a means to make her dancing profitable. They were looking for a peddler who was easy on the eyes and exuded confidence. Flykr enjoyed the freedom the Guild granted her, and the chance to meet with beings of all walks of life. Mostly, she sells and mends dance costumes (her mother being a seamstress, she developed a basic skill in sewing) and she has been know to be able to help beings find musical instruments, music, books and the like.

After graduating from the College of Glamour, Flykr took to travel. She often managed to book passage on ships by being the Dancing Entertainment. Some of the first places she visited Dera Dagoram, The Fortress of Light, and a few others. It was in Dera Dagoram that she met Eobard. He was part of the audience one night as she performed on a vast stage for all to witness. 

Throughout her travels, Flykr has met many beings. Which has been both a blessing, and a concern. When one lives a life of adventure, following one’s heart in an effort to seek love, admiration and fulfillment, one can sometimes become forgetful. This is the case with a being named Carlyle. Carlyle claims to have seen Flykr dancing in a grand palace a few years back. He approached her after her performance, buying her a drink and chatting her up. According to him, the two had a wonderful night together. But the next morning, he was sent on his way by his employers and was forced to leave her behind. But he has never forgotten her. Flykr, unfortunately, did forget Carlyle. For try as she might, she could not remember anything about the performance as some unnamed palace. She couldn’t recall a being buying her a drink. And she definitely did not remember spending some incredible night with said being. In fact, the only reason she knows any of this is from the letters Carlyle sends her. Somehow, no matter where she is or what she is doing, she still receives letters from Carlyle confessing his undying devotion to her and how he will find her again, someday. These letters find her via a large, black raven at least once every other week. Flykr is torn between wishing she could remember this man and their shared night, and finding the whole thing just a bit creepy. But he has never done or said anything to suggest he wishes her any ill-will. And with every letter, he shares that he somehow knows her very well. He has even hinted that he has seen her recently, but didn't have the opportunity to approach her and rekindle their connecting. So she gladly accepts the letters, sends some favor in return and keeps Carlyle’s letters in a special locked box at the bottom of her back pack.

### Tilda / Fallon

<img src="/images/Tilda.jpg" alt="" />

**Player:** Heather Domaszek

**Organization:** Black Sun

**Class:** Wizard (Diviner)

**Race:** Imperial Human

**Background:** ?

#### Backstory

Tilda is a 24 year old human wizard from Kandor.  Around 5 years ago, Tilda was working in a book shop when she was framed for a for the murder of Duke Sebastian Mathis, Lord of Westport. The book shop owner, Eduard was not so lucky as to escape. Tilda managed to escape Kandor before she was arrested and executed, and she fled to Dormania.  Tilda was forced to live a nomadic existence as a fugitive, constantly moving from town to town, with detailed wanted posters of her face and alleged crime always dogging her steps.  She took occasional odd jobs, and stole when necessary to survive.  Once her street smarts improved and she developed a routine, Tilda's focus turned from survival to revenge.  She joined the Black Sun in Farengar, hoping to eventually hunt down the person or persons responsible for framing her.  At this point, she realizes it is futile to try to clear her name or get her old life back.  Justice under the law is a pipe dream.  The only thing left for her is vengeance.  She runs around disguised as a man and calls herself Fallon.  She wears baggy clothes and an occasional fake beard, and she compensates for her feminine features with over the top, stereotypical masculine  behavior.  Scratching, spitting, cursing, drinking, etc. She's developed quite the alcohol tolerance this way, as she engages in frequent drinking contests.  (Bascially if Gaston does it, Tilda does it).

Her mentor, Sarkis, as someone who doesn't share your wizardly skills, felt she needed someone who could help her grow her particular skill set.  He recommended she and her friend Yeva go to Cur'Estan to work with Kyman Hexhammer, a renowned Black Sun guild master originally from Curinor and a skilled wizard.

### Barbarious

**Player:** Derek Reinfreid

**Organization:** Masters of the Deep Song

**Class:** Barbarian (Storm Herald)

**Race:** Orc (Grunt)

**Background:** Entertainer

#### Backstory

His parents would travel the land performing music, so he never really had a land to call "home". After hearing a great warrior play the bagpipes before entering battle, Barbarous wanted to play them. His father enrolled him in the same college as Flyker Moon (he did not know her at the time), in hopes that he would realize the faults in his instrument and play the lute like a true bard. While Barbarious could play a tune, and sometimes even out perform his fellow classmates, his inconsistancy and random chaotic solos caused him to fail. When he was finally kicked out of school, he searched for the bagpipe playing warrior. He spent many nights listening to the winds hoping that the beautiful sound would fill his ears. After almost giving up on his dreams, he threw his bagpipes in the trash below his window. A few moments later he heard his bagpipes playing the unforgettable tune he'd heard as a child. Barbarious ran to the alleyway and met the Orc barbarian, Mugg. They spent many years together learning music and battle tactics. Mugg eventually had to travel for a large battle overseas, and recommended the Masters of the Deep for a place of worship and music. Barbarous reluctantly took his advice, and sought out the pale, Dwarves, subterranean land. Although many would find it hard to believe, they accepted him quickly as one of their own. That's what he's been up to.
