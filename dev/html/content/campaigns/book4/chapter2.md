  <h1>Chapter 2: Escape from Northport</h1>

  <div id="chapter2preparation">
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      Players may opt to mop up the remaining raiding parties before returning to Cur'Estan. There are 3 additional raiding parties scattered around the area.  Each raiding party has between 3-6 orcs 1-3 hobgoblins, 1-3 goblins, and 1-2 worgs.  One Orc from each group should be a claw of luthic or a sword of ilnevall.  If they return to Cur'Estan first to deliver the information they recovered, General Heartbren will tell them that he will send soldiers to deal with the other raiding parties, and ask them to come back the next day for new orders.

      The next day General Heartbren will have the parties new orders for them. As before, any factions the party members belong to will have additional orders for their members.
    </p>
    <h3>Orders</h3>
    <h4>General Heartbren's Orders</h4>
    <p>
      That Orc army is moving on Northport far too quickly for us to intercept, and they outnumber us 6 to 1 besides.  I need you to get down there and organize an evacuation before the army gets there. -Gerad Heartbren
    </p>
    <h4>Black Wolf Irregulars Orders</h4>
    <p>
      A high ranking member of Amathera's Shield has been living in Northport and may be able to help you. Find Malia Demonslayer and make sure she makes it back to Cur'Estan. Her organizational abilities will be critical in managing the new influx of refugees. -Gerad Heartbren
    </p>

      <strong>Amathera's Shield Orders: </strong> A high ranking member of Amathera's Shield has been living in Northport and may be able to help you. Find Malia Demonslayer and make sure she makes it back to Cur'Estan. -Jaxan Chin
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Artificer's of Mechanus Orders: </strong> There's an old gnome mechanic by the name of Biggles Wump who retired to Northport some years ago. He probably still has copies of the plans to some of his old ideas. These plans need to stay out of the hands of those who aren't part of the Artificer's, make sure they aren't left behind for the Orcs. -Margo
    </p>-->
    <h4>Black Sun Orders</h4>
    <p>
      I have a spy who I need inserted into the Orc army, but he tends to cause, distrust, among humans. Get him to Northport and make sure he is safe until the city is empty, then he'll do his part when the Orc army gets there. -Kyman Hexhammer
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      <strong>Champions of Cora Orders: </strong> Our scrying suggests the orcs are employing necromancers to strike fear into the citizens and keep them from fleeing. Kill them. Also we have heard rumors of an artifact being stored by the Guild of Heroes that in the right hands could bring hope to those poor people.  Retreive it, and use it to aid the fearful. -via sending
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dormanian Imperial Guard Orders (Alexandra is Empress/Gloryheart is Emperor): </strong> The local garrison in Northport was stripped of experienced soldiers over the last couple of years to bring more men to the front, but with proper training those soldiers could reinforce those here. Make sure the men of the garrison make it out alive. -Ambassador Gloryheart
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Guild of Heroes Orders: </strong> We have a major chapterhouse in Northport, though most of the staff are already gone, one of our guild masters, Allison Highwater, has refused to leave. Find out what is keeping her there and help her deal with the problem so she can get to safety.  -Feril Honeybait
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>International Grangemaster's Alliance Orders: </strong> There is a lot of unworked land around Cur'Estan, and we will need experienced farmers to work it and feed all those refugees.  Don't forget the people living out in the country when you are handling the evacuation. -Winslow Fredericks
    </p>-->
    <h4>Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans Orders</h4>
    <p>
      Northport is a major center of trade and has vast storehouses full of all kinds of goods and supplies owned by guild members.  You need to find a way to get those goods transported north as well as the people. -Kendrick O'mally
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      <strong>Keepers of the Grove Orders: </strong> That orc army has been ripping through the countryside with no regard for life. You must raise the alarm among the local druids that those orcs are coming. Additionally, there is an ex-druid there who betrayed the secrets of druidic. Elhavir Soras must be brought before the local Druids council to answer for his crime. -via sending
    </p>-->
    <h4>Lords of the Rising Dawn Orders</h4>
    <p>
      Tacticly, I think it would be smarter to focus on delaying the orcs rather than on hurrying the evacuation. Destroying bridges, illusory foes, and so on should slow the orcs down enough that the bulk of the people in Northport could escape, and kill a few orcs at the same time. -Duke James Lightbringer
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      <strong>Maker's of Legend Orders: </strong> There is nothing heroic about soldiers fleeing before the enemy. You need to make sure there is some kind of heroic last stand to delay the oncoming attackers or we won't have good story material. -Haera Oelefros
    </p>-->
    <h4>Masters of the Deep Song Orders</h4>
    <p>
      The dwarven emissary to Gerasalim had fled to Northport shortly before Strovenguard fell, expecting the queen to flee there as well. Instead she took control of the armies in the east and left the emissary in the lurch.  Get him this stone, it's a one use teleport that he can use to escape back to Curinor. -Ogrun Firebreath
    </p>
    <h4>Shepherds of the All-Mother Orders</h4>
    <p>
      The Orcs have employed necromancers to scare the people into staying in Northport.  How dare they give necromancy a bad name by using the undead for simple scare tactics. Kill these necromancers, then prove to the people of Northport that they have nothing to fear from the dead. -Gimble Beren
    </p>
    <h4>Silver Dragon Knights Orders</h4>
    <p>
      There is an old copper dragon named Sulac who lives in a cave near Northport. While I doubt he would help you directly, he is an old friend of the Emperor, and we would hate to see him threatened by these orcish invaders. -Farnor Spiketooth
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      <strong>Sylvan's Rangers Orders: </strong> Vanriel Glamfara is a skilled member of our order who recently took control of the garrison there in Northport. We could use someone of her experience here in Cur'Estan, and she can surely help you in your evacuation efforts. Talk to her, and make sure she makes it out of there alive. -Sondel Fistin
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trollkin Mercenary Corps Orders: </strong> The warchief of that orc army has refused to pay for the 300 mercenaries he's employing, but is blocking efforts at communication from Degak'Ta to his army. Those soldiers are being reassigned to Cur'Estan.  Get in there and deliver their orders. -Drog Stonearm
    </p>-->
    <h3>Travelling to Northport</h3>
    <p>
      Northport is 660 miles south of Cur'Estan.  Players should be made aware that a normal fast pace may leave them little time to organize things in Northport before the Orcs arrive on the 14th of Sylvanus.  If one of the players is an Artificer of Mechanus, Margo will be willing to teleport the party to Northport if they have not angered her. Alternatively, the party can attempt to take a riverboat to Northport, in which case they must travel 310 miles to the Kandor River, and then 530 miles by boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the party travels over land. Use the travel pace rules from the Player's Handbook for normal terrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the party attempts to take the river, use the travel pace rules from the Player's Handbook for the first 310 miles, then have them roll a chance die every day to see what kind of boats they see and consult the table below.
    </p>
    <table class="table">
      <thead><tr><th>Result</th><th>Boat</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1-20</td><td>They see only a single keelboat, slowly ambling up the river (16 miles a day), and unwilling to take on passengers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>21-40</td><td>They see only a single keelboat, slowly ambling up the river (16 miles a day), willing to take on passengers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>41-60</td><td>In addition to a keelboat, they see a river galley travelling at half pace up river (100 miles a day) and willing to take on passengers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>61-100</td><td>They encounter a river galley travelling at full speed up river (200 miles a day) and willing to take on passengers.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      During travel, when the party gets close to Northport, do one of the following random encounters from the random encounters section in this chapter:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Raid</li>
      <li>Bandits</li>
      <li>Hungry Werebears</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="chapter2northport">
    <h2>Northport</h2>
    <p>
      Northport is the last major city in Gerasalim not in Orc hands.  It is filled to the brim with refugees from the south, crime is out of control, news from the outside world is scarce, and rumors regularly send the streets into a panic.  The outlying farms are regularly attacked by orc raiders, and recently anyone attempting to leave the city has found themselves under attack by the undead.
    </p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <h4>1. Riverside Market</h4>
    <p>The center of trade in the town.  Goods that come off the docks mostly get bought and sold here.  As trade has died and refugees poured in, the market has become a tent city.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Duke's Park</h4>
    <p>The Duke's private game reserve, after Duke Resel fled the city for Kaland, this too was turned into space for refugees.  The deer and other game are long gone, having already been used to feed the populace.</p>
    <h4>3. Duke's Palace</h4>
    <p>The Ducal palace has been turned into the new headquarters of the city guard.</p>
    <h4>4. The Southern Market</h4>
    <p>Goods traveling north by road from Strovenguard and Eastguard are typically bought and sold at the Southern Market. Sometimes also called the 'duty-free' market, since there is no tax on goods bought and sold there, unlike the Riverside Market.</p>
    <h4>5. Temple of Cora</h4>
    <p>The Temple of Cora is the largest temple in town. They have put out a call for Champions to come and aid the city.</p>
    <h4>6. Temple of Sara</h4>
    <p>The Temple of Sara has served the areas farming population for many years, but is currently struggling to find a response to their growing concerns about raiders and attacks.</p>
    <h4>7. Temple of Maris</h4>
    <p>The Temple of Maris is a shadow of its old self. Once one of the busiest temples in the city, it is now tended by a single cleric with a few acolytes. The temple still has its old teleportation circle, but no one remains with the skill to activate it.</p>
    <h4>8. Druid's Grove</h4>
    <p>The local druids often convene in this space outside the city where they discuss recent events and scouting reports. The druids are not friendly to outsiders in their space, and locals know to avoid the grove.</p>
    <h4>9. Temple of Dorman.</h4>
    <p>Attendance at the Temple of Dorman has been down, and most of the senior clerics had already left the city before things got bad.</p>
    <h4>10. Hotel District.</h4> 
    <p>Most of the inns in town are centered in the Hotel District, where the two major highways through town converge, just north of the river.</p>
    <h4>11. Temple of Amathera.</h4>
    <p>The Temple of Amathera was the first place to fill up with refugees, before other spaces became available for them.  The local clerical staff looks overworked and despondent.  Malia Demonslayer has her office here, from which she coordinates the efforts of Amathera's Shield in the city.</p>
    <h4>12. Temple of Alohim.</h4>
    <p>The temple of Alohim is second only to the temple of Cora in size, yet has one of the smallest segments of worshippers of the major temples in town.  Sitting directly across from the Ducal palace, the building was a gift from Duke Resel.</p>
    <h4>13. The Dragon's Brew Inn.</h4>
    <p>The Dragon's Brew is the largest inn in town, and sells the best beer. Run by the unlikely ex-adventuring duo, Erestor and Ralf, it is also likely the safest inn in town, as Ralf serves as both brewmaster and bouncer that noone wants to piss off, while Elhavir's keen eye and random conversation locates trouble before it happens. </p>
    <h4>14. The Guild of Heroes Chapter House.</h4>
    <p>Northport has been a major center for the Guild of Heroes for a number of years. The chapter house was largely evacuated some time ago, but the local Guildmaster still lives in the chapter house alone.</p>
    <h4>15. To Sulac's Lair.</h4>
    <p>Sulac the copper dragon has his cave lair about 30 miles west of Northport.</p>
    <h4>To Orc Army.</h4>
    <p>The Orc army is south of Northport, moving towards it at a pace of about 15 miles a day, and set to arrive (if not delayed) on the 14th of Sylvanus.</p>
    <h4>17. To Cur'Estan</h4>
    <p>the Northeast road leads to Dormania and eastern Kandor, including Cur'Estan. Refugees attempting to escape along the road have all been attacked by orcs or undead.</p>
    <img class="col-sm-12" style="max-width:100%;" src="/images/maps/cities/northport.png" alt="map of northport" />
    <h3>Important People in Northport</h3>
  
    <h4><a href="/runner/vanrielglamfara">Vanriel Glamfara</a></h4>
    <p>
      Vanriel is an ex-adventurer and ranger of some notable skill.  Originally a Black Wolf Irregular before an incident at the Fortress of Light saw her dishonorably discharged, the circumstances of her leaving the fortress are questionable.  Officially pardoned by the Irregulars after official petition from Zelfir in recognition of her service to that country.  She joined up with the local city guard in Eastguard after that, and rose to the rank of captain before the city was taken.  Managed to secure an orderly retreat and evacuation before the orcs burned the city.  Now she has taken control of the local guard of Northport, trying to whip the raw recruits into good enough shape to get things under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanriel herself feels overwhelmed by the task in front of her, she does not feel she is built for command, but has been thrust into the role by her men who look up to her, and the necessity of needing someone to take charge.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/maliademonslayer" target="_blank">Malia Demonslayer</a></h4>
    <p>
      Malia started out her career as an aberration hunter working for Amathera's Shield and the College of Malidal.  After a leave of absence to recover her erstwhile brother from Malinval she spent a short time working for the Guild of Heroes before reconnecting with Amathera's Shield to try to organize the refugees that were pouring into Northport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malia is intelligent, but abrassive.  She has been successful in organizing things like living space, food, schools, etc for the refugees, but has struggled with how to tamp down the rumors that spread through the city causing riots and other trouble.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/elhavirsoras" target="_blank">Elhavir Soras</a></h4>
    <p>
      The ex-druid Elhavir was once an adventuring companion to Vanriel, and like her spent some time in Eastguard afterwards. After the druids of Gaian discovered he taught their secrets to another who had no intention of being or becoming a druid he went into hiding to escape their wrath. He is currently hiding among the refugees in the Riverside Market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elhavir has lost access to his druidic magic, and sold off his old equipment long ago.  Yet he is still driven inside by a rage stemming from the death of his old animal companion, one that manifests itself in the form of directed fire that he can create at will.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/erestor" target="_blank">Erestor</a></h4>
    <p>
      The free-wheeling ranger Erestor runs the Dragon's Brew with his friend Ralf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erestor's previous life had him facing all kinds of creatures after a freak accident left him stranded on the other side of the world.  During this time he befriended, and then later saved, Ralf.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/ralf" target="_blank">Ralf</a></h4>
    <p>
      The half-dwarf monk Ralf runs the Dragon's Brew inn with his friend Erestor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralf's ownership of the Dragon's Brew is the culmination of his lifelong goal to discover the best recipes for beer in the world. His quest saw him at various times possessed, fighting cults of Malik, and treking through the desert, but somewhere along the line he found what he was looking for.  Now even dwarves who come to Northport leave raving about the beer at the Dragon's Brew.
    </p>
    <h4>Duke Resel.</h4>
    <p>
      The local Duke was a wealthy merchant appointed by the Queen because of his business acumen. A greedy coward at heart, he fled the city when he heard that Strovenguard had fallen and fled to Kaland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke Resel left most of his possessions behind, and left no one in charge in the city in his stead, even conscripting the local guard captain as his escort. This left a power vacuum that others have struggled to fill in order to just maintain some semblance of order in the city.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/ancientcopperdragon" target="_blank">Sulac</a></h4>
    <p>
      The Ancient Copper Dragon, Sulac has lived in the hills west of Northport for hundreds of years.  He has watched conquering armies come and go, happily conversing with mortals who find their way to his cave, but never involving himself in their affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sulac has not ventured out of his cave for some years, and the inner chambers are quite difficult to access for non-dragons.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/allisonhighwater" target="_blank">Allison Highwater</a></h4>
    <p>
      Allison Highwater is the local guildmaster for the Guild of Heroes.  She was always considered something of an odd duck, but has been acting especially odd lately.  She has sequestered herself in the guild hall, refusing to come out even though the rest of the guild's members have long since left town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allison's refusal to leave is tied to a set of magical artifacts that the Guild of Heroes acquired over the years. They were placed at the end of an intricate protective gauntlet that is nearly impossible for a single person to pass through on their own, even knowing all of the traps.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="/runner/harwikgreenskin" target="_blank">Harwik Greenskin</a></h4>
    <p>
      Harwik Greenskin is Kyman Hexhammer's spy. If one of the party members is associated with the Black Sun, Kyman will ask the party to bring him with to Northport so he can stay behind and insert himself into the orc army.  He is a goblin, and an escaped slave who became an assassin working for the Black Sun. His mission is to get as close as possible to the orc warlord and use his sending stone to get intelligence  on the orc armies future movements back to Kyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Harwik is a goblin he is immediately distrusted in Northport by the common folk, and whenever he is with the party in a street location there is a 20% chance of him being attacked by random commoners.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="chapter2riot">
    <h2>Arrival in Northport</h2>
    <h3>Riot</h3>
    <p>
      Things begin going wrong for the players the minute they arrive in Northport.  Whether they teleport in, get off a boat, or simply walk into town, immediately there are cries from the crowd in the street of 'Orc spies!', 'The Orcs are attacking!' and 'The undead are here!'.  A pair of unarmed kobolds walking through the street, the player characters, and a gaunt looking old man are immediately set upon by the crowd as people begin screaming.  Members of the crowd are commoners, and the street is packed with them, roughly 50 of them are involved in the riot.  Any commoner who can't reach a target on its turn will begin to riot and break or steal whatever they can reach.
    </p>
    <p>After 10 rounds of combat, 10 members of the city guard will arrive from all sides led by Vanriel Glamfara.  They are wielding clubs, and their threat of overwhelming force will put an end to the riot.  If the party has already dealt with all rioters by that point without killing anyone, Vanriel will thank them and invite them back to her office.  If the party used deadly force on the rioters, she will take them into custody for manslaughter. The kobolds and old man, if still alive, will also be taken into protective custody.</p>
    <h4>Guard Captain Vanriel Glamfara</h4>
    <p>
      Vanriel is willing to answer the parties questions.  If they are in custody, she will interrogate them each individually about their role in the riot, what happened, etc. She is relatively easy to convince that the party acted in self-defense.  If they are not, then she will talk to them over dinner, a relatively meager affair of bread and cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      She will give the party what information she has on the goings on in town.  She knows the locations of all the major landmarks in town.  She knows the attacks by the undead happen quickest on the north side of town, and suspects the necromancers are hiding out in that direction.  She is aware of the location of Sulac's Lair, but doesn't know anything else about him. She has no information on the orc army and it's proximity to the city, and is very concerned about the information the party has if they offer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She refuses to be taken into custody by the party, and claims (truthfully) that she was pardoned.  If the party presses she will resist, aided by whatever guards are in the room with them.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/vanrielglamfara&guard&guard&guard&guard">Run this Encounter</a></h5>
    <p>
      She asks the party to do the following things to enable the towns escape:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deal with the necromancers that have been attacking travelers (see Necromancers on the Edge of Town).</li>
      <li>Find a way to delay the Orc army (see Delay the Orc Army).</li>
      <li>Find out from Malia Demonslayer what is needed to evacuate the refugees (see Evacuation of Northport).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      She will pay their room and board at the Dragon's Brew while they are in town.
    </p>
    <h3>The Dragon's Brew Inn</h3>
    <p>
      The Dragon's Brew, like every other inn in town, is packed, but rooms have been cleared out for the party by the proprietors, Ralf and Erestor.  If the party is escorting Harwik Greenskin they will offer him their special safe room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralf and Erestor are happy to converse with the party, offering adventuring stories, great food and the best beer in the world.  They will interrogate the party about the availability of good beer in Cur'Estan, and actively consider relocating to the town since Northport isn't likely to last long.  They ask the party to make sure to secure a decent wagon for the bar when evacuation time comes so that they can make sure to bring along their secret ingredients and brewing equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralf and Erestor will also tell the party about any of the side quests they did not receive orders about previously, mentioning a rumor that the trollkin working with the orcs have not recently been paid, that the local druids have been showing up in the city looking for someone, that Allison Highwater, the Guild of Heroes guildmaster, is holed up in her chapter house refusing to leave, and that there is an ancient copper dragon west of town with a massive rumored horde. They do not bring up Biggles Wump unless asked.  If asked they can point the way to his house.
    </p>
    <h3>The Old Artificer</h3>
    <p>
      Biggles Wump has a house in town.  He's a grumpy old gnome and refuses to open the door unless convinced.  He will refuse to participate in the evacuation, and says the party, and the orcs, will get his old plans over his dead body.  If the party gets inside the house, the house is filled with bookshelves covered in books of arcane plans for magical items and advanced gadgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggles sees Margo as an upstart kid who doesn't respect her elders, and is unconvinced by attempts to bring her into the picture. He is not frightened by the orcs or the prospect of being killed. He is done with life and only cares about not moving from his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party will notice if they are conversing with Biggles that he is mostly blind, relying on massive spectacles to see at all, and his hearing is not great either.  He will often ask them to repeat themselves, or misunderstand what they said (Biggles has disadvantage on all perception checks, is not proficient, and has a wisdom of 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggles also does have family in town, and will talk about them (at length) if asked (or if not asked). While his wife died years ago, his daughter, Giggles Wump, and grandkids live a few doors down and visit him often.  He has photographs (taken with a camera of his own design) that he will pull out of one of the book shelves and insist on showing the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the party talks to Giggles about her father's refusal to leave, she will agree to talk to him and will convince him to leave so that he can help his grandchildren escape.
    </p>
    <h3>The Druid's Grove</h3>
    <p>
      The local druid's regularly gather at a small grove just west of the city.  Recently they have been making trips into the city itself looking for Elhavir Soras, who committed the crime of teaching an enemy of Gaian their secret language. Elhavir himself is hiding in the refugee camp at the Riverside Market, but he has eluded detection by the druid's thus far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Player's who are not members of the Keeper's of the Grove may be alerted to this search by Erestor and Ralf at the Dragon's Brew.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the players side with the druids and attempt to take Elhavir into custody, he will fight back, and if she learns of it, Vanriel will cease to provide help to the party.  The druids will thank the party for their assistance on delivery of Elhavir, alive or dead, and give them a wand of cure wounds in payment. If alerted to the proximity of the orc army by the players the druids will leave, scattering to the winds.
    </p>

      If the player's ask for the druid's assistance they can aid in delaying the orc army, using wild animals to harry the orcs supply lines. This results in a net delay of 1 day for every 5 days of travel the orcs have yet to make.

      If the player's side with Elhavir he will ask to be taken to Vanriel so she can smuggle him out of town.  He will give them a Wand of Detect Magic as a reward.  Two of the druid's (use NPC entry from the Monster Manual for Druid) will intercept the party on their way to the City Guard's headquarters and attack them assisted by 3 giant spiders (attacking from the rooftops) and 2 giant eagles.

    <h2>Necromancers on the Edge of Town</h2>
    <p>
      For the past several months everyone trying to leave the city has been attacked by undead.  Any time the players leave the city they will be attacked by undead within an hour (see Undead Raid in the random encounter section of this chapter).  
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever attacks them, they leave relatively obvious tracks that lead back to the necromancers camp.
    </p>
    <h3>The Necromancer's Camp</h3>
    <p>
      The necromancers have been harassing the town for a good two months now, and are well set in. Though their camp is out in the open, and does not have the benefit of predicting where attacks may come from. The necromancers believe they will be able to deal with any threat that shows up, and have set up traps to simply alert them to intruders. Once an alarm is raised, the necromancers spend a minute to create a huge skeleton to aid them against the incoming forces.
    </p>
    <h4>Zombie Moat</h4>
    <p>
      The encampment is surrounded by a ditch that is 15ft wide and 20ft deep (dug by zombies). The zombies that dug out the pit are still in it (14 total, and armed with shovels). The zombies also start growling at people they see, which alert the rest of the camp.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></h5>
    <h4>Patrols</h4>
    <p>
      These patrols travel in groups of 3, 1 wight and 2 skeletons armed with heavy crossbows. Players can expect to see at least 3 such groups randomly patrolling. One of the skeletons in the group has a bell, and will ring it loudly (as an action) when it see intruders. These skeletons join together to fight intruders if the alarm is raised, and will notice if the zombies in the pit start making noise.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/wight&skeleton&skeleton" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></h5>
    <h4>Watch Towers</h4>
    <p>
      5 wooden watch towers have been set up within the camp. Each tower is 30 ft. high with a single ladder that leads to an upper platform.  The upper platform has half walls that provide partial cover. On top of each tower is 4 skeletons with heavy crossbows. These towers are positioned equidistant from one another (50 ft apart) and give a full circle of watch. The skeletons are quite dumb however, and only sound the alarm and attack if humans approach. A simple disguise, a large shrub, or a blanket could make the skeletons not bother attacking.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/skeleton&skeleton&skeleton&skeleton">Run This Encounter</a></h5>
    <h4>Ogre Zombie Pits</h4>
    <p>
      Similar to the first trap, there are sporadically zombie pits hidden in the area. A player that isn’t paying attention has an 80% chance of walking into a pit, and must make a DC 12 Dex Save or fall into a pit with an Ogre Zombie at the bottom. The necromancers have walked through the camp enough to know where the pits are by heart, and a DC 13 survival check reveals the paths that the necromancers have worn down (triggered automatically, no need for the player to guess at having to do one.). Alternately a passive perception of 16 or higher will notice any pits within 15 ft of a player automatically.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/ogrezombie" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></h5>
    <h4>Tortured Citizens</h4>
    <p>
      Some of the people from the town, those that attempted escape or attempted to fight the necromancers are chained to posts in the inner area of the camp. Each of these people are trapped with a glyph of warding, if the person is removed by some daring hero, the hero and the hostage explode for 5d8 thunder damage (DC 14 Constitution save for half). This creates a loud booming sound that alerts the skeleton patrols and the necromancers. The citizens are unconscious and have level 5 exhaustion (speed of 0). If given water or food some of them can mention that the necromancers did some magic thing to the pole they are chained to, but are not aware what it does. The rune itself is obvious, and a DC 15 arcana check will identify it's effect.
    </p>
    <h4>Noisemakers</h4>
    <p>
      Lastly near the center of their camp the necromancers have set up noisemakers in the form of a curtain of bones on strings. The curtain entirely surrounds the camp, and there is no clear entrance. The noise maker simply makes rattling which alerts the skeleton patrols, and gives the necromancers enough time to summon their giant skeleton.
    </p>
    <h4>Necromancer's Tent</h4>
    <p>
      Inside the tent are the necromancers. Ironically, they don’t like to have undead in the room with them, and instead just a big piles of bones in a chest, along with anything else they may need.

  <div id="chapter2sulac">
    <h2>Sulac's Lair</h2>
    <h4>Path to the dragon</h4>
    <p>
      The path to the dragon is a long winding upward sloping path, originally designed for carts to be carried up, back when the dragon still accepted offerings. Along the way there are six signs that read, in order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Danger! Dragon ahead, do not enter.</li>
      <li>No, seriously, real dragon ahead, do not enter.</li>
      <li>Real acid breathing dragon, actually real, will kill you.</li>
      <li>If you are seeking to kill the dragon, know that it is protected under Gerasilim law and attacking it is a felony punishable by 5 years in prison</li>
      <li>If you are seeking to talk to the dragon, know that it hates visitors and will not permit entry. It is also a dragon and will probably kill you</li>
      <li>Well you're here, the dragon is ahead, any chance to live past today is in the other direction. Choose wisely.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Lair itself contains a series of traps that prevent access to the dragon.
    </p>
    <h4>First Trap</h4>
    <p>
      Before you is a giant pit that seems to disappear with how far down it is. There is a single rope ladder bridge that spans the pit. The bridge is useless, and is designed to throw people off as it only has a single anchor point on each end. Any character that uses the bridge must pass a DC 25 Dex check to cross or be tossed off the bridge. The dragon has set up a permanent feather fall spell in the pit, which funnels into a tunnel to drop off people at the base of the mountain with a sign that reads "don't come back."
    </p>
    <h4>Second Trap</h4>
    <p>
      Frictionless floor trap. A long hallway that is 10ft wide and 80ft long is stretched in front of you. There is a safe platform that is 5ft long before the trap begin, so that players can see their fate. The next 10ft is a pit trap that leads into the same feather fall tunnel as the previous trap, so that players can see the sign. After that is 40ft of obviously very smooth sleek metal surface. This surface is on the floor, walls and ceiling is completely frictionless. A player on the surface cannot stop or change direction or jump. After the 40ft of slip and slide is another 10ft long pit trap that again leads to the exit. There is then a 5ft platform for the players to land on. The back wall has an illusion of a wall 10ft before the actual wall, so attempts to shoot an arrow with a rope simply goes through the illusion. The back wall is slanted to prevent arrows from sticking in. The entire area is hallowed to prevent teleportation. 
    </p>
    <h4>Third Trap</h4>
    <p>
      Man eating plants. The tunnel is filled with giant Venus fly trap like plants, that hide in brush and reach out to eat passerby's. The plants then attempt to forcibly teleport anyone they are eating via the transport via plants spell, it is a DC 14 charisma save to avoid this, and a DC 14 strength save to escape. Burning down the plants is a very bad idea however, as the plant matter burns a black smoke which fills the cavern, blinds them, suffocates them, and alerts the dragon to the party being complete morons. There is an obvious sign that says “Burn my garden and I’ll kill you”.
    </p>
    <h4>Fourth Trap</h4>
    <p>
      The final trap is just a programmed illusion of the dragon. It appears to be sleeping, whenever anyone wakes it up or speaks directly to it the illusion activates. It wakes up with a roar of fire into the air, then aggressively and continually threatens anyone that sticks around, talking over people and not listening to anything they are saying. The illusion also activates the dragons fear aura.
    </p>
    <h4>Victory</h4>
    <p>
      Eventually if they stick around the illusion resets, if the players are still there they can see the entrance to the dragons lair behind the illusion. There the dragon is actually sleeping, and is much more willing to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sulac is unwilling to help against the necromancers or to directly confront the orcs. He will reward the party with one random magic item from his horde.  Sulac is willing to attack the orcs supply caravans for the party.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="chapter2guildofheroes">
    <h2>The Guild of Heroes</h2>
    
    <h4>Entering the guild</h4>
    <p>
    The guild is already abandoned. Nothing of value is left and nobody is around. In the center area there is a trap door that has been left open, and players can vaguely hear somebody talking to herself. Below in the trap door is Allison Highwater who is currently trying to insert two keys into two different slots on different sides of the room at the same time by throwing chairs. Players can easily convince her to help the cause if they help her open the door. She stresses that all of the magic items stored inside are evil and dangerous.      
    </p>
    <h4>Room 1: Monster Trap</h4>
    <p>
      The first room has a hydra in it that is loose but cannot escape through the door they came in as it closes behind the players. The guild leader assures the players that the hydra is well trained and will not attack them. The players enter the room and the hydra attacks. After the hydra is defeated (the guild leader wants it taken alive), the leader will explain that she has a ring that is supposed to calm it, but forgot it.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/hydra&allisonhighwater" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></h5>
    <h4>Room 2: Mirror Room</h4>
    <p>
      When they enter this room it has full length mirrors along the walls. Once the players are in the room the mirrors cast Simulacrum from each player, creating a snow clone of each one that they have to fight. The clones only have half of their HP, but all of their abilities.
    </p>
    <h4>Room 3: Cursed Treasure</h4>
    <p>
      The next room is filled with hundreds of thousands of gold, gems, jewelry, amazing weapons and armor. The guild leader simply says “don’t touch it” and moves forward without a glance behind her. Everything in the room mimicks. All of it, everything, its mimicks all they way down. They are kept in a stupor by the guild and only awaken when touched.
    </p>
    <h5><a href="/runner/mimic&mimic&mimic&mimic&allisonhighwater">Mimic</a></h5>
    <h4>Room 4: Riddles that Aren't Meant to be Solved</h4>
    <p>
      In this room a door gives each person a question that must be answered. The trick of it, that the guild leaders tell them, is that they must give the wrongest answer possible. When the right answer is given, a spout of fire shoots down from the ceiling.  The person answering the riddle must make a DC 15 dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success. Some example riddles are in the table below:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>Room 5: Overly Complex Puzzle Room</h4>
    <p>
      This room is impossible to solve without having known the answer ahead of time, and is super deadly. The guild leader handles this one herself.
    </p>
    <h4>Room 6: Treasure Room</h4>
    <p>
      Within the room is a dozen different magical barriers to prevent scrying, wishes, or teleportation. Here the guild leader uses mage hand to put the magical artifacts into a bag of holding saying they are all dangerous and need to be kept out of enemys hands, or any hands for that matter. She mentions the Cora weapon and says the party can have it if they want, it’s a dumb weapon anyways. The artifact she gives the party is Luna, the Sword of Limitless Hope (if the Champion of Cora in the party does not wield a sword, subsitute an appropriate weapon type, such as a crossbow, longbow, mace, etc)
    </p>
    <p>
      With the issue dealt with, Allison will be able to help the party on one other task (such as fighting the Necromancers, delaying the orc army, getting to Sulac, etc), and will leave Northport with the refugees.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <h4>Luna, The Sword of Limitless Hope (Weapon, greatsword, legendary)</h4>
      <p>
        The Sword of Limitless Hope was forged by Cora herself as a gift to her greatest champion during the Neran Cataclysm.  Used to strike down the Lich King of Nerim, the sword was believed lost, with occasional rumors of it appearing in a dragon’s horde, or a beholder’s dungeon. The Guild of Heroes discovered it during a routine contract, and hoping to take advantage of the obviously magical sword, attuned to it without researching its capabilities first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luna is sentient, and will only allow devout followers of Cora to attune to her. Her intelligence is 12, wisdom is 10 and charisma is 20.  Luna speaks telepathically with someone who is attuned to her, but is silent for all others. She has darkvision and can hear normally for 60 ft., beyond which she is blind and deaf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luna refuses to retreat in the face of her enemies, and will resist any attempt to leave enemies undefeated, or to act dishonorably.  Additionally, she believes strongly that all undead must be destroyed and if she hears of any necromancers or undead nearby she will insist they be destroyed immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Curse:</strong> Anyone who attempts to attune to Luna who is not a devout follower of Cora immediately loses control of the sword, which gains a fly speed of 30 ft. and focuses only on attacking them.  These attacks have a +7 to hit, dealing 2d6+5 slashing damage.  This effect can be ended by the remove curse spell, ending the attunement.
      </p>
      <h4>Luna (initiate)</h4>
      <p>
        A devout follower of Cora who first attunes to Luna can treat Luna as a +1 weapon and gains the following benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Light:</strong> Luna sheds bright light out to 30 ft, and dim light for an additional 30 ft. This effect can be turned on or off as a bonus action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fearless:</strong> While attuned to and holding Luna you cannot be frightened.
      </p>
      <h4>Luna (devout)</h4>
      <p>
        A devout follower of Cora attuned to Luna who proves their devotion to Cora and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds gains the ability to treat Luna as a +2 weapon and adds the following ability:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Light Burst:</strong> As an action the wielder can raise Luna towards the sky and command Luna to shine even brighter for a brief time, dealing 3d6 radiant damage to creatures within 10 ft (except the wielder), suppressing any magical darkness within 60 ft, and shining bright light out to a distance of 120 ft. This effect ends at the end of your next turn, after which Luna cannot shed light of any kind until the next dawn.
      </p>
      <h4>Luna (Champion)</h4>
      <p>
        An adventurer who has reached the highest echelons of the Champions of Cora and is attuned to Luna treats Luna as a +3 weapon and gains the following benefits in addition to all those listed above:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hunter:</strong> While attuned to and holding Luna you can cast the spell Hunter’s Mark at will.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Radiant Damage:</strong> Luna does an additional 1d6 radiant damage, or an additional 3d6 radiant damage against undead.

  <div id="chapter2delayorcs">
    <h2>Delay the Orc Army</h2>
    <p>
      The Orc army is travelling 15 miles a day towards Northport from the south.  Potentially leaving very little time to evacuate the refugees.  Vanriel and Malia will both suggest finding ways to delay the orcs after the necromancers are dealt with.  There are a number of ways to delay the orcs, detailed below.
    </p>
    <h4>Recruit Sulac to attack the supply caravans</h4>
    <p>
      Sulac can easily lay waste to the lightly defended orc supply chain.  Recruiting him to do so will delay the orcs by 3 days as they are forced to spend time stripping the countryside for food.
    </p>
    <h4>Burn bridges</h4>
    <p>
      There is one bridge the orcs need to cross for every 45 miles of travel they still need to reach Northport.  For each bridge burned, the orcs are delayed by 1/2 a day.
    </p>
    <h4>Recruit the guard to raid their supplies</h4>
    <p>
      The city guard could attempt a raid on the orcs supplies, stealing wagons, food, and medicine. They would be likely to take heavy casualties, but a successful raid would delay the orcs by 3 days.
    </p>
    <h4>Deliver the Trollkin's Orders</h4>
    <p>
      The trollkin contingent in the orc army has not been paid their due and has been denied communication with Trollkin High Command.  Deliver the orders from high command to abandon the army (or otherwise convince them to leave) and it will cause chaos in the orc army, delaying them by a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trollkin refuse to help the party under any circumstances (outside of abandoning the orc army), as it is against Trollkin policy to attack a previous employer, even for non-payment, for 1 month after termination of the contract.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="chapter2evacuation">
    <h2>Evacuation of Northport</h2>
    <p>
      Malia Demonslayer has a number of things she needs to evacuate the refugees.  While some refugees would be able to leave as soon as the necromancers are dealt with, for most to survive to Cur'Estan additional supplies are needed.

    </div>
    <h4>Hand Carts</h4>
    <p>
      Hand-drawn supply carts would allow the strong and able to pull with them food and other supplies for their families.  Children would be able to ride in the carts pulled by their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supply carts can be obtained in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the players visit the Orc army and deliver the Trollkin's orders, the Trollkin will be willing to sell their supply carts to Malia for cheap (this subtracts 1 day from the necessary construction time of the other options).</li>
      <li>Have the refugees build them themselves (takes 1 week of time).</li>
      <li>Organize the towns skilled tradesmen to build them (takes 3 days of time)</li>
      <li>Have at least 100 wagons (enough space to no longer need supply carts)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Food</h4>
    <p>
      The city is already running out of food, and does not have enough to feed everyone for the journey.  They would need enough food to feed the people for 40 days, and currently have 200,000 person days of spare food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extra food can be obtained in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have the city guard attempt to raid the orc army and steal their supply wagons (would lead to heavy casualties among the guard, 50% chance Vanriel dies), acquire 100,000 person days of food.</li>
      <li>Conscript the local druids to join on the trip and create food (10,000 person days).</li>
      <li>Conscript the remaining clerics from all of the towns temples to join the trip and create food. Clerics from each temple will be able to provide the following amount of food:
        <ul>
          <li>Alohim: 10,000 person days</li>
          <li>Amathera: 0 days worth (already fully committed)</li>
          <li>Cora: 15,000 person days</li>
          <li>Dorman: 5,000 person days</li>
          <li>Maris: 1,500 person days</li>
          <li>Sara: 30,000 person days (wands of create food and water)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Have the refugees help the local farmers strip the fields (provide 20,000 person days extra food per day, cannot start until necromancers dealt with)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Wagons</h4>
    <p>Transporting the sick and elderly will require better than just hand carts. Given their numbers, to transport them all we will need at least 50 or so horse or ox drawn wagons.</p>
    <p>Wagons can be obtained in the following ways.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have the refugees attempt to construct the wagons (takes 2 weeks of time for 50 wagons, or 4 weeks of time for 100 wagons).</li>
      <li>Have the towns skilled tradesmen build them (takes 1 week of time for 50 wagons, or 2 weeks of time for 100 wagons).</li>
      <li>Have the city guard attempt to raid the orc army and steal their supply wagons (would lead to heavy casualties among the guard, 50% chance Vanriel dies), obtain 100 wagons.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Medicine</h4>
    <p>
      Medicine for the sick is in short supply. There are two ways to obtain medicine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Convince the local druids to supply medicine by spending their time on the journey scouring the woods for herbs.</li>
      <li>Steal the orcs medicine supplies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Convince Vanriel to Abandon the City</h4>
    <p>
      Vanriel will be absolutely unwilling to leave the city if the majority of the populace still remains, so for the guard to leave there must be enough resources for the poor to leave town and the necromancers must be dealt with.  If there are not enough resources for the sick and elderly she must be persuaded to leave (DC 20 charisma persuasion check).  If there are enough resources for everyone to leave town she will leave without needing convincing.
    </p>
    <h4>Assault on the Refugee Caravan</h4>
    <p>
      The Orc army, realizing their trap has failed, will make a last ditch attempt to stop the refugees for escaping, detaching a unit to move double time and intercept the refugee caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party can aid in the defense, however they are only a small part of the overall defense.  If the city guard has suffered severe casualties, they will be nearly wiped out by the attack and there will be a 50% chance that Vanriel dies in that case.  Additionally 500 refugees will parish in the attack in that case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party will be confronted with a contingent of orcs.

    <h4>Hungry Werebear</h4>
    <p>
      The party encounters a werebear eating a corpse mutilated beyond recognition.  It is clearly feral and starving, and tries to scare the party away but does not attack unless the party attacks first.
