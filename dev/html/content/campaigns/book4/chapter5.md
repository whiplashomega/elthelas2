    <h3>Orders</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>General Heartbren's Orders: </strong>  -Gerad Heartbren
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Black Sun Orders: </strong> Before you track down the real traitor, I need you to help me use the situation to recruit a new agent. Giggle's Wump, one of the refugees who just arrived, may be the key to one of my plans succeeding. I need you to mix up some fake evidence that she is involved in this treason issue, then confront her with it. Tell her I can help her make the problem disappear, and then bring her to me. -Kyman Hexhammer
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans Orders:</strong> -Kendrick O'mally
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lords of the Rising Dawn Orders: </strong> We need to worry more about who this traitor was selling information to than who in particular the traitor was. We have many potential enemies in the world. Find out all of their contacts, track them down, and kill them for seducing someone to evil. -Duke James Lightbringer
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Masters of the Deep Song Orders: </strong> -Ogrun Firebreath
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shepherds of the All-Mother Orders: </strong> Bring us the traitors corpse after they are justly executed.  I will ensure that they can redeem themselves after death. -Gimble Beren
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Silver Dragon Knights Orders:</strong> A traitor seems unlikely, it is probably the fault of poor scrying protections on important planning meetings. Inspect the protections and then install these non-detection runes. -Farnor Spiketooth

    <h3>Haera's Dungeon</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, the heroes of the story have solved the mystery and discovered the Makers of legend treachery and have come to the makers of legends headquarters to seek justice. The leader is there in the greeting room waiting for them, she already knows how this all ends.
    </p>
    <h4>Evil Monologue</h4>
    <p>
      For as long as the players will allow her. The leader (I forget her name) goes on an evil monologue about her plans cannot be stopped, and all the world will know of her infamy. She mentions she has already won, and the evil ritual to destroy the entire resistance camp is nearly complete in the basement of the headquarters. She offers the players the choice, they can fight to kill her (which she points out is meaningless), or they can race to the basement to stop the ritual from completing. If the players think about splitting up, she mentions it will take all of them to even have a chance to succeed in either task. In reality, the person they are speaking to is a major illusion, the leader loves tropes, and wants the heroes to have to make difficult choices, but expects them to make the heroic choice every time.
    </p>
    <h4>Basement Entrance Riddle</h4>
    <p>
      In the basement are 12 statues, each that has a different appearance. A theif, a whore, a scholar,  a drunk, a king, a jester, a knight, a guard, a wizard, a warlock, a monk, and a merchant. On the door is a riddle that says “The entrance to the liar lies at the heart of both my enemies”. The players will reason that two of the statues needs to be destroyed to open the door. The answer of course is the jester, who mocks and belittles the endeavors of real adventurers, and the scholar, that bothers to record what actually happened instead of a good story. The rest of the statues explode when destroyed, and deal 5d8 fire damage in a small area around them.
    </p>
    <h4>Overly Dramatic Fight Scene</h4>
    <p>
      When they enter the first room, it looks like a theatre. On the stage is the leader who welcomes them to their doom. She mentions how foolish the heroes are to try and stop her, and offers them a chance to join her. She makes promises of gold power and anything else they could desire, if only they would join her. Once the players dramatically say they will never join her, she claps her hands, and hidden openings in the walls reveal 8 lions, which are hungry and attack. If the players are silly enough to try to accept or even to lie about accepting, she gets upset and says they are doing it wrong, and lets loose the lions anyways. The lions are just hungry, not even that compelled to fight, and could just be offered food to stop. If they do this the leader says they are doing it all wrong. Again she is just a major illusion in the room, but has set up a clever way of casting either command or suggestion during the fight, just to make the heroes cower in fear or something equally dramatic.
    </p>
    <h4>Entirely Unnecessary Lava Trap</h4>
    <p>
      Moving through the theatre room is a large pit of lava, and rickety bridge for the players to cross. The leader has hallowed this area, and teleportation or flight will not function. The bridge is designed to make dramatic falling scenes, and has many ready to break wooden boards on it, as well as a gust of wind trap to try to blow players to the edge of the bridge, requiring a dex save. When hanging from the bridge, it twists and is not able to climbed by the hanging person, and they need to be saved from someone else in the party. If the players should fail and fall into the lava, that’s ok because it’s supposed to look dramatic, not lethal. The lava is an illusion and below is a nice comfy landing area. Once fallen down no noise or object can pass back through the illusion. There is an obvious staircase that leads them ahead into the next area. But a modify memory trap is placed on the door, which changes that players memory into “Your firey death sends your soul to the afterlife, there before you stands (insert relevant god) who says ‘the great evil of (leaders name) cannot be allowed to pass! I shall restore you to life so that you may triumph this day! Know that I can only do this once ever, and have chosen you because your task is so great and important’. Then they are brought back to life.”
    </p>
    <h4>Pointless Trail of Purity</h4>
    <p>
      The door before them is a black and cold void of a hallway. Anyone that ties to enter takes acid and cold damage, similar to the hunger of hadar spell. Before the hallway them is a petrified angel, that says using the magic mouth spell in a divine voice, that only the pure may receive the angels blessing to pass through. A player need to pray and dedicate themselves to some good god of their choice, to receive the angels blessing. While blessed, they glow faintly, and can pass through the room without harm. Again this is all illusions, and the “blessing” is just being considered friendly in the hunger of hadar spell, so it no longer affects them.
    </p>
    <h4>Silly Philosophical Puzzle</h4>
    <p>
      In this room there are 5 refugees that are trapped. Similar to the necromancers, they are tied to poles with a trap that will kill them if they are attempted to be rescued. A magic mouth spell goes off in the room when the players enter. “If you attempt to rescue any of them, I shall kill them all. However, if you kill one of them, I shall let them all go”. The refugees are all simulacrums, so killing them just leaves behind a puddle of snow. The heroes are supposed to refuse to do evil however, and killing them is the wrong thing to do. The magic mouth thing will laugh at them if they do it, and will set off the explosives killing the rest anyways.
    </p>
    <h4>Difficult Choice Room</h4>
    <p>
      Before them is a clearly impossible to open metal door, and a red button before them. A magic mouth spell does off when they enter to room that says,” what will you give to save everything? The button before you will open the door and give you the chance to defeat me. But! It will also incinerate the hostages. To their left is a glass panel. Behind it is a group of some of the refuges they have rescued, be sure to include some that the players like or would feel bad for. The glass prevents teleportation and is immune to all damage as if it was a see through metal wall. And when the button is pushed the refugees burn alive. Make sure to mention how horrifying the scene and their screams are.  In reality, the refugees have all been paid a good sum of money to act this all out, thinking this is part of a prank or some game. They all pretend to be horribly burned alive, but the fire is an illusion. Once the scene plays out, the bodies look to be still and charred, and the translucent wall fades to black, and the door opens. Players can talk with the refugees, some will beg them not to push the button, some will be heroic and tell the party to do it. The room the refugees are in is filled with a constant enhance ability, and glibness spell. Making their deception checks a minimum of 17.
    </p>
    <h4>Last Chance to Leave and Save Their Lives</h4>
    <p>
      Before the final chamber, is a teleportation circle inscribed on the ground. The leader has provided a scroll of teleportation, as well as the teleportation sigil to someplace safe. There is a note that says “This is your last chance to save yourself, use this scroll to escape while you still can. Otherwise I will be forced to kill you all in the next room”. The scroll is actually real, but the sigil she gives that would teleport them to safety is actually just the sigil in that very room. So even if they try to use it to escape, they don’t. Fleeing isn’t heroic.
    </p>
    <h4>The Players Arrive Too Late</h4>
    <p>
      Of course the players were never meant to arrive in time, and the leader has completed her master plan exactly when they show up. The ritual is finish and she has summoned the destruction of world to life, the mighty Terrasque. Sadly, even though she wanted to, she couldn’t get the real terrasque, instead it is a stone golem with an illusion on it, that is huge instead of large. The golem roars and acts like it is a terrasque, but has the statistics of a stone golem. She mentions that is must be weak from the summoning (another evil ritual trope), but it should be enough to kill the players. Then the final battle of her (down many spell slots at this point), and the “Terrasque” fight to kill the players. She makes certain to never finish off a downed opponent. If someone is at 2 failed death saves, she will healing word them then knock them back out, saying “You can’t die just yet, I’m not done with you” or something like that.
    </p>
    <h4>Victory</h4>
    <p>
      Finally, the champions have won. With her dying breath she mentions her study in the back has her biography, and they should send a message to the guy in the notes to get it published. Indeed in the back room is exactly what she described. It also details every trap in the dungeon, and how there really wasn’t much danger at all to begin with.
