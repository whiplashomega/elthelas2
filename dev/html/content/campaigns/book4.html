<p><strong>Gerasalim is in Flames</strong>. The Fortress of Light has fallen, Strovenguard is an occupied city, Eastguard has been reduced to rubble, and Northport is under imminent threat.  The last of the Gerasaline armies have retreated to the Sword Mountains, attacking the orc armies from caves and hidden strong points. </p>

<p><strong>The Moon Elves are nearly extinct</strong>.  After 2 years of being hunted in their homeland their numbers have been reduced to a few thousand refugees who have fled into Eldoran, Curinor, and Gerasalim.</p>

<p><strong>The Dwarves have retreated to their holds</strong>.  No major hold has ever fallen to a foreign invader, and the Dwarves have withdrawn their armies to wait out the crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Eldoran is in civil war</strong>.  The sudden extinction of the royal line and the ascension of the relatively incompetent Derandel to the throne left a massive power vacuum that various local lords have risen to fill.  Only the Waelin region on continental Elathia still fights against the Orcs, now desperate for reinforcements as Orc armies march directly on their borders.</p>

<p><strong>Dormania has withdrawn from the Alliance</strong>. The ascension of Aladon Maristos to the Imperial Throne as Dorman XXIII led quickly to a peace treaty between Dormania and Malinval, meanwhile any who oppose the Emperor’s will suffer violent deaths, and the Emperor has promised to reclaim Kandor for the empire.</p>

<p><strong>Kandor fights invasion from 2 sides</strong>.  The Orcs are now on the unfortified southern border of Kandor, sending raids north while they attempt to deal with the remaining Gerasaline armies, meanwhile the Dormanian legions threaten invasion from the East.</p>

<p><strong>Into this destruction Gerad Heartbren, last commander of the Black Wolf Irregulars, has put out one last desperate call for recruitment</strong>.  You have answered this call, for reasons of your own, and have travelled to the fortress of Cur’Estan in the woods of Kandor, where the he is gathering the forces that will make a last desperate stand against evil in Elathia.</p>

<p>Cur'Estan was once the fortress capitol of an ancient minor Kandori king, destroyed by Dorman I and left as a ruin in the woods.  20 years ago the Black Wolf Irregulars rebuilt the central castle to serve as their headquarters, and over the twenty years since a small town has sprung up around the castle serving the needs of the castle.  Over the last year, as the orcs have ravaged Demal'Thor, and then moved into Gerasalim, refugees have slowly trickled into the town.  A refugee camp has sprung up on the outskirts, now threatening to outnumber the original residents.</p>

<p>The de facto ruler of Cur'Estan is General Gerad Heartbren of the Black Wolf Irregulars.  He commands the castle, and roughly 2000 soldiers, the last remains of the Black Wolf Irregulars forces.  </p>

<p>The massive castle, with it's 30 ft thick walls, and 100 ft tall keep towers over the town in the west.  It contains large storehouses, stables, smiths, and fletchers who supply the soldiers.
</p>
<p>The town itself is dominated by the large stone embassy buildings, one for each of the Alliance nations, Kandor, Gerasalim, Dormania, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran.  Today only the Kandori Embassy is occupied, the rest have been abandoned, with only a caretaker cleaning crew assigned by Gerad to keep them from falling into disrepair.  The streets of the town are winding and haphazard.  The town was built quickly, with no particular plan, as merchants and tradesmen gravitated towards the town to fill the needs of the castle garrison and soldiers stationed there. The area directly in front of the castle gate is kept clear except in the mornings, when the merchants from the town, farmers, and hunters from the surrounding area set up temporary stands to sell goods.</p>
<p>
  To the south of the castle is the barracks of the Black Wolf Irregulars, approximately 1500 soldiers stay in the barracks (in addition to the 500 or so garrisoned in the castle).  The area west of the barracks is used as a training ground.
</p>
<p>To the south of the town is the refugee camp, housing about 1000 refugees, managed by a contingent of Amathera's Shield, about 50 strong.  The refugees are welcome in town, and occasionally one will have the funds to build a proper house in the town itself, the rest are housed in large tents in the camp, each housing as many as 50 people.</p>
<p>
  The southeast, between the town and the refugee camp, sits the permament complex of the Lords of the Rising Dawn.  An order of knights and paladins headquartered in Kaland.  The order has approximately 1000 soldiers garrisoned here in 4 large barracks buildings.
</p>
<h3>Important People in Cur'Estan</h3>
<h4>Gerad Heartbren</h4>
<p>
  The now aging Moon Elf general is a gifted strategist and the de facto leader of the resistance forces, as they have come to be known since the dissolution of the Alliance.  His tribe was wiped out by the Orcs shortly after the fall of Aridhem, while he was commanding troops at the Fortress of Light, then he was reassigned to Cur’Estan shortly before the Fortress of Light’s own fall.  He blames himself for not being present for either battle, and is now determined to do better.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Goals: </strong> Gerad, as one of the few surviving moon elves of influence, is particularly concerned about finding and protecting any Moon Elf refugees he comes across.  He wants to see the Orcs removed from his homeland of Demal Thor. He was a young adventurer when the Alliance of 6 Nations was formed, and was an early believer in the future of peaceful relations.  He wants to see the Alliance come back together, and even bring in more members if possible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Gerad holds a strong distaste for slavery and anything that shares similarities to it, such as serfdom or wage slavery.
</p>
<h4>Duke James Lightbringer</h4>
<p>
  Cleric of Alohim, Ambassador of the King of Kandor, and Commander of the Kandori armies in the east, Lightbringer is a leader of the Lords of the Rising Dawn.  He has a thousand Kandori soldiers at his command, and a contingent of skilled Paladins dedicated above all to wiping out the Orcs.  Despite all the setbacks, General Lightbringer remains constantly optimistic about their chances of success.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Goals: </strong> Duke Lightbringer is a loyal vassal of the Kandori king, and will not rebel against his leige lord.  He is dedicated to ensuring the security of Kandor's borders, and wants to wipe out the Orc race. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Duke Lightbringer is a strong believer in the divine right to rule, and does not like that a common born person such as General Heartbren is in command at Cur'Estan.  He hates non-humans, particularly the green-skin races such as orcs and goblins, but has no love lost for elves, dwarves, halflings, or gnomes either.
</p>
<h4>Master Bard Haera Oelefros</h4>
<p>
  Haera Oelefros has led the Makers of Legend in Kandor for 15 years, and is convinced that the next grand story for the ages will come from the exploits of the resistance members.  She has brought a small contingent of bards with her to document what is going on, embedding them in various units she hopes will prove legendary.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Goals: </strong> Write the next major epic poem, preferably featuring herself as the hero.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Anyone who she thinks is more important than her.
</p>
<h4>Kyman Hexhammer</h4>
<p>
  The Black Sun leader from Stromforde was appalled at the Dwarves decision to withdraw from the war.  He may not care about nations, unity, or goodness, but the destruction wrought by the Prince of Fiends and his Orc armies has made the ‘legitimate’ acquisition of wealth difficult.  He now uses his many connections to recruit spies and assassins for the resistance, for a fee of course.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Goals: </strong> Get filthy rich, make sure the Resistance has enough money and resources to make him filthy rich.  Get revenge on Dorman XXIII for kicking him and his contacts out of Dormania.
</p>
<p>
  Dislikes: People who worry too much about honor and let it get in the way of getting things done (or his future wealth).  Anyone who fails to pay him for services rendered.
</p>
<h4>Quartermaster Wyrmling Trapsmith</h4>
<p>
  The tiny kobold quartermaster was once an Orc slave before escaping.  He has proven himself incredibly adept at numbers and organization of supplies.  He is incredibly loyal to General Heartbren, who liberated his mine from the orcs.  His clan now controls a silver mine in the Dragons Teeth Mountains, just on the Demal'Thor side of the border.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Goals: </strong> Secure a ready supply of food and weapons for Cur’Estan.  Make sure the number of mouths to feed doesn’t exceed the available supplies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Refugees (or anyone) who doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the community.
