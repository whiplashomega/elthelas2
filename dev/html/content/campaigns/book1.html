<p>The Crystal of Light is the first of a series of campaigns in historical order, set more or less 1 right after the other with different groups of heroes.  The Crystal of Light details how everything went wrong, and the lives of the heroes caught up in it.  Later books refer to several of the 'standard' heroes listed here.  If you play through several campaigns with the same group you can replace the standard heroes with the heroes of your players in the later campaigns to provide a check-in as to the continuation of the world, and the fate of their players.  Any of the standard heroes that don't have a decent analog among the players can be presented as friendly NPCs who aid the players through the campaign.</p>

<h3 id="elhavirsoras">Elhavir Soras</h3>

<p> Elhavir was a devoted druid following Sylvan, training to be the next priest of Sylvan for his tribe when his little sister ran away and joined the army for a 'lark', lying about her age to do so.  Elhavir promised his parents he would bring her home, and joined up with the Black Wolf Irregulars after they promised to post him in the same unit as her.</p>

<p>Elhavir fills the role of party healer and general spellcaster, and can be replaced by any PC who fills that role, such as a Cleric, Druid, Bard, or Sorcerer (favored soul).  If the party does not have anyone to fill that role, consider having Elhavir join the party as an NPC.  Elhavir as an NPC will immediately reveal that Imse is not a Druid, and she will be sent home unless the party intervenes.  Elhavir as an NPC would choose Circle of the Land (grasslands) at 2nd level.  He focuses on learning battlefield control and healing spells.</p>

<p>At first level an NPC Elhavir normally prepares the following spells:</p>
<h4>Cantrips</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sheleleigh</li>

<h4 id="training">Training</h4>

<p>The squad's first week is spent in training.  Training events can include: marching in formation, one on one weapons training, foreign language classes, or skill training.  The first day the players will be introduced to all of the options, after which Sergeant Coras will encourage them to pick one thing to focus on while they wait for orders. Depending on their choice, they should make a check (detailed below) and if successful they will gain particular benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Weapons Training:</strong> A successful DC 13 strength or dexterity check (for finesse, light, or ranged weapons) will grant a +1 bonus to damage rolls with weapons of the chosen type.</p>

<p><strong>Skill Training:</strong> The check type depends on the skill being trained.  Dexterity skills require a Dexterity check, intelligence skills an intelligence check and so on.  The DC is always 13.  If the check is successful, the player gains +1 to ability checks with the chosen skill.</p>

<p><strong>Language Training:</strong> A successful DC 13 intelligence check allows the player gains the ability to understand the basics of a new language of their choice.  They will instantly be recognized as a foreign speaker by natives, but will be able to interpret basic written text and speech from that language and communicate basic ideas to others.  Additional training later can improve the players abilities in the language further.</p>

<p><strong>Formation Drills:</strong> A successful DC 13 constitution check will allow the player to occassionally perform a burst of speed.  The player can use a bonus action to move half their speed on their turn.  Once they use this ability they cannot do so again until they finish a short rest.</p>

<p>On the last day there is a sparring tournament.  Players are given non-lethal melee weapons of their choice that do one less damage than normal, they cannot use any spell that would do damage to their opponent, or deal any lethal damage to the opponent.  It is a single elimination random bracket tournament between the players and the various NPC members of the squad (except Sergeant Coras).  The winner gets to pick either a level 1 spell scroll, a new weapon, studded leather armor, a breastplate, or splint mail.</p>

<h4 id="thefirstmissionwolvesandcows">The First Mission - Wolves and Cows</h4>

<p>Sergeant Coras wakes the squad up on the first day of the second week with their first mission.  The previous night a caravan leading cattle down from Strovenguard was attacked by wolves that appeared out of nowhere, and disappeared again once the cattle were dead.  The merchants who were leading the caravan straggled into the fortress on foot in the early morning hours.  The party is to investigate the attack and make sure the next caravan, to arrive that evening, arrives without casualties.</p>

<p><strong>What is going on:</strong> The wolves are being summoned by a druid whose connection to nature has been corrupted by the death and destruction in the Blighted Gap.  The druid is hiding at a nearby camp.  If left unmolested, the Druid will attack and destroy the next caravan, and the next, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Reward for Success:</strong> On a success the squad is payed a 500 gp bounty, which is split evenly among anyone who survived the mission by Sergeant Coras.  For every additional caravan that is destroyed the reward drops by 100 gp.  If the party has not solved the issue within 5 days the mission will be reassigned to a different squad and the squad will be given a black mark for dereliction of duty.</p>
