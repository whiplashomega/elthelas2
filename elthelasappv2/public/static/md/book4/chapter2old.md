# Chapter 2: Escape from Northport

## Preparation

Players may opt to mop up the remaining raiding parties before returning to Cur'Estan. There are 3 additional raiding parties scattered around the area. Each raiding party has between 3-6 orcs 1-3 hobgoblins, 1-3 goblins, and 1-2 worgs. One Orc from each group should be a claw of luthic or a sword of ilnevall. If they return to Cur'Estan first to deliver the information they recovered, General Heartbren will tell them that he will send soldiers to deal with the other raiding parties, and ask them to come back the next day for new orders.

##### [Run Raiding Party 1](/runner/orc&orc&orc&orcclawofluthic&hobgoblin&hobgoblin&goblin&goblin&worg&wrog)

##### [Run Raiding Party 2](/runner/orcbladeofilneval&orc&orc&orc&orc&orc&hobgoblin&hobgoblin&hobgoblin&goblin&worg&worg)

##### [Run Raiding Party 3](/runner/orcbladeofilneval&orc&orc&orc&hobgoblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&worg&worg)

The next day General Heartbren will have the parties new orders for them. As before, any factions the party members belong to will have additional orders for their members.

### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders

That Orc army is moving on Northport far too quickly for us to intercept, and they outnumber us 6 to 1 besides. I need you to get down there and organize an evacuation before the army gets there. -Gerad Heartbren

#### Black Wolf Irregulars Orders

A high ranking member of Amathera's Shield has been living in Northport and may be able to help you. Find Malia Demonslayer and make sure she makes it back to Cur'Estan. Her organizational abilities will be critical in managing the new influx of refugees. -Gerad Heartbren

#### Black Sun Orders

I have a spy who I need inserted into the Orc army, but he tends to cause, distrust, among humans. He is a goblin named is Harwik Greenskin. Get him to Northport and make sure he is safe until the city is empty, then he'll do his part when the Orc army gets there. -Kyman Hexhammer

#### Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans Orders

Northport is a major center of trade and has vast storehouses full of all kinds of goods and supplies owned by guild members. You need to find a way to get those goods 
transported north. -Kendrick O'mally

#### Lords of the Rising Dawn Orders

Tacticly, I think it would be smarter to focus on delaying the orcs rather than on hurrying the evacuation. Destroying bridges, illusory foes, and so on should slow the orcs down enough that the bulk of the people in Northport could escape, and give our other squads a chance to pull people out of the outlying towns. Make sure you delay them by at least a week to give us sufficient time. -Duke James Lightbringer

#### Masters of the Deep Song Orders

The dwarven emissary to Gerasalim had fled to Northport shortly before Strovenguard fell, expecting the queen to flee there as well. Instead she took control of the armies in the east and left the emissary in the lurch. Convince him to use this stone, it's a one use teleport that he can use to escape back to Curinor. -Ogrun Firebreath

#### Shepherds of the All-Mother Orders

The Orcs have employed necromancers to scare the people into staying in Northport. These necromancers have clearly lost their way. Convince them that they are misusing the power of Nera. -Gimble Beren

#### Silver Dragon Knights Orders

There is a reclusive old copper dragon named Sulac who lives in a cave near Northport. While I doubt he would help you directly, he is an old friend of the Emperor, and we would hate to see him threatened by these orcish invaders. Find him and warn him of the impending attack. -Farnor Spiketooth

### Travelling to Northport

Northport is 660 miles south of Cur'Estan. They will receive their orders on the 18th of Trimalan, so players should be made aware that a normal fast pace may leave them little time to organize things in Northport before the Orcs arrive on the 14th of Sylvanus. If one of the players is an Artificer of Mechanus, Margo will be willing to teleport the party to Northport if they have not angered her. Alternatively, the party can attempt to take a riverboat to Northport, in which case they must travel 310 miles to the Kandor River, and then 530 miles by boat.

If the party travels over land. Use the travel pace rules from the Player's Handbook for normal terrain.

#### Arrival dates based on standard paces

    <tr><td>Fast + 3 + galley</td><td>River</td><td>Trimalan 28</td><td>16</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If the party attempts to take the river, use the travel pace rules from the Player's Handbook for the first 310 miles, then have them roll a chance die every day to see what kind of boats they see and consult the table below.

#### Boat table

<table class="table">
<thead><tr><th>Result</th><th>Boat</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1-20</td><td>They see only a single keelboat, slowly ambling up the river (16 miles a day), and unwilling to take on passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21-40</td><td>They see only a single keelboat, slowly ambling up the river (16 miles a day), willing to take on passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>41-60</td><td>In addition to a keelboat, they see a river galley travelling at half pace up river (100 miles a day) and willing to take on passengers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>61-100</td><td>They encounter a river galley travelling at full speed up river (200 miles a day) and willing to take on passengers.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

During travel, when the party gets close to Northport, do one of the following random encounters from the random encounters section in this chapter:

*   Raid
*   Bandits
*   Hungry Werebears

## Northport

Northport is the last major city in Gerasalim not in Orc hands. It is filled to the brim with refugees from the south, crime is out of control, news from the outside world is scarce, and rumors regularly send the streets into a panic. The outlying farms are regularly attacked by orc raiders, and recently anyone attempting to leave the city has found themselves under attack by the undead.

### Features

#### 1\. Riverside Market

The center of trade in the town. Goods that come off the docks mostly get bought and sold here. As trade has died and refugees poured in, the market has become a tent city.

#### 2\. Duke's Park

The Duke's private game reserve, after Duke Resel fled the city for Kaland, this too was turned into space for refugees. The deer and other game are long gone, having already been used to feed the populace.

#### 3\. Duke's Palace

The Ducal palace has been turned into the new headquarters of the city guard.

#### 4\. The Southern Market

Goods traveling north by road from Strovenguard and Eastguard are typically bought and sold at the Southern Market. Sometimes also called the 'duty-free' market, since there is no tax on goods bought and sold there, unlike the Riverside Market.

#### 5\. Temple of Cora

The Temple of Cora is the largest temple in town. They have put out a call for Champions to come and aid the city.

#### 6\. Temple of Sara

The Temple of Sara has served the areas farming population for many years, but is currently struggling to find a response to their growing concerns about raiders and attacks.

#### 7\. Temple of Maris

The Temple of Maris is a shadow of its old self. Once one of the busiest temples in the city, it is now tended by a single cleric with a few acolytes. The temple still has its old teleportation circle, but no one remains with the skill to activate it.

#### 8\. Druid's Grove

The local druids often convene in this space outside the city where they discuss recent events and scouting reports. The druids are not friendly to outsiders in their space, and locals know to avoid the grove.

#### 9\. Temple of Dorman.

Attendance at the Temple of Dorman has been down, and most of the senior clerics had already left the city before things got bad.

#### 10\. Hotel District.

Most of the inns in town are centered in the Hotel District, where the two major highways through town converge, just north of the river.

#### 11\. Temple of Amathera.

The Temple of Amathera was the first place to fill up with refugees, before other spaces became available for them. The local clerical staff looks overworked and despondent. Malia Demonslayer has her office here, from which she coordinates the efforts of Amathera's Shield in the city.

#### 12\. Temple of Alohim.

The temple of Alohim is second only to the temple of Cora in size, yet has one of the smallest segments of worshippers of the major temples in town. Sitting directly across from the Ducal palace, the building was a gift from Duke Resel.

#### 13\. The Dragon's Brew Inn.

The Dragon's Brew is the largest inn in town, and sells the best beer. Run by the unlikely ex-adventuring duo, Erestor and Ralf, it is also likely the safest inn in town, as Ralf serves as both brewmaster and bouncer that noone wants to piss off, while Elhavir's keen eye and random conversation locates trouble before it happens.

#### 14\. The Guild of Heroes Chapter House.

Northport has been a major center for the Guild of Heroes for a number of years. The chapter house was largely evacuated some time ago, but the local Guildmaster still lives in the chapter house alone.

#### 15\. To Sulac's Lair.

Sulac the copper dragon has his cave lair about 30 miles west of Northport.

#### To Orc Army.

The Orc army is south of Northport, moving towards it at a pace of about 15 miles a day, and set to arrive (if not delayed) on the 14th of Sylvanus.

#### 17\. To Cur'Estan

the Northeast road leads to Dormania and eastern Kandor, including Cur'Estan. Refugees attempting to escape along the road have all been attacked by orcs or undead.

### Important People in Northport

#### [Vanriel Glamfara](/runner/vanrielglamfara)

Vanriel is an ex-adventurer and ranger of some notable skill. Originally a Black Wolf Irregular before an incident at the Fortress of Light saw her dishonorably discharged, the circumstances of her leaving the fortress are questionable. Officially pardoned by the Irregulars after official petition from Zelfir in recognition of her service to that country. She joined up with the local city guard in Eastguard after that, and rose to the rank of captain before the city was taken. Managed to secure an orderly retreat and evacuation before the orcs burned the city. Now she has taken control of the local guard of Northport, trying to whip the raw recruits into good enough shape to get things under control.

Vanriel herself feels overwhelmed by the task in front of her, she does not feel she is built for command, but has been thrust into the role by her men who look up to her, and the necessity of needing someone to take charge.

#### [Malia Demonslayer](/runner/maliademonslayer)

Malia started out her career as an aberration hunter working for Amathera's Shield and the College of Malidal. After a leave of absence to recover her erstwhile brother from Malinval she spent a short time working for the Guild of Heroes before reconnecting with Amathera's Shield to try to organize the refugees that were pouring into Northport.

Malia is intelligent, but abrassive. She has been successful in organizing things like living space, food, schools, etc for the refugees, but has struggled with how to tamp down the rumors that spread through the city causing riots and other trouble.

#### [Elhavir Soras](/runner/elhavirsoras)

The ex-druid Elhavir was once an adventuring companion to Vanriel, and like her spent some time in Eastguard afterwards. After the druids of Gaian discovered he taught their secrets to another who had no intention of being or becoming a druid he went into hiding to escape their wrath. He is currently hiding among the refugees in the Riverside Market.

Elhavir has lost access to his druidic magic, and sold off his old equipment long ago. Yet he is still driven inside by a rage stemming from the death of his old animal companion, one that manifests itself in the form of directed fire that he can create at will.

#### [Erestor](/runner/erestor)

The free-wheeling ranger Erestor runs the Dragon's Brew with his friend Ralf.

Erestor's previous life had him facing all kinds of creatures after a freak accident left him stranded on the other side of the world. During this time he befriended, and then later saved, Ralf.

#### [Ralf](/runner/ralf)

The half-dwarf monk Ralf runs the Dragon's Brew inn with his friend Erestor.

Ralf's ownership of the Dragon's Brew is the culmination of his lifelong goal to discover the best recipes for beer in the world. His quest saw him at various times possessed, fighting cults of Malik, and treking through the desert, but somewhere along the line he found what he was looking for. Now even dwarves who come to Northport leave raving about the beer at the Dragon's Brew.

#### Duke Resel.

The local Duke was a wealthy merchant appointed by the Queen because of his business acumen. A greedy coward at heart, he fled the city when he heard that Strovenguard had fallen and fled to Kaland.

Duke Resel left most of his possessions behind, and left no one in charge in the city in his stead, even conscripting the local guard captain as his escort. This left a power vacuum that others have struggled to fill in order to just maintain some semblance of order in the city.

#### [Sulac](/runner/ancientcopperdragon)

The Ancient Copper Dragon, Sulac has lived in the hills west of Northport for hundreds of years. He has watched conquering armies come and go, happily conversing with mortals who find their way to his cave, but never involving himself in their affairs.

Sulac has not ventured out of his cave for some years, and the inner chambers are quite difficult to access for non-dragons.

#### [Allison Highwater](/runner/allisonhighwater)

Allison Highwater is the local guildmaster for the Guild of Heroes. She was always considered something of an odd duck, but has been acting especially odd lately. She has sequestered herself in the guild hall, refusing to come out even though the rest of the guild's members have long since left town.

Allison's refusal to leave is tied to a set of magical artifacts that the Guild of Heroes acquired over the years. They were placed at the end of an intricate protective gauntlet that is nearly impossible for a single person to pass through on their own, even knowing all of the traps.

#### [Harwik Greenskin](/runner/harwikgreenskin)

Harwik Greenskin is Kyman Hexhammer's spy. If one of the party members is associated with the Black Sun, Kyman will ask the party to bring him with to Northport so he can stay behind and insert himself into the orc army. He is a goblin, and an escaped slave who became an assassin working for the Black Sun. His mission is to get as close as possible to the orc warlord and use his sending stone to get intelligence on the orc armies future movements back to Kyman.

Because Harwik is a goblin he is immediately distrusted in Northport by the common folk, and whenever he is with the party in a street location there is a 20% chance of him being attacked by random commoners.

## Arrival in Northport

### Riot

Things begin going wrong for the players the minute they arrive in Northport. Whether they teleport in, get off a boat, or simply walk into town, immediately there are cries from the crowd in the street of 'Orc spies!', 'The Orcs are attacking!' and 'The undead are here!'. A pair of unarmed kobolds walking through the street, the player characters, and a gaunt looking old man are immediately set upon by the crowd as people begin screaming. Members of the crowd are commoners, and the street is packed with them, roughly 50 of them are involved in the riot. Any commoner who can't reach a target on its turn will begin to riot and break or steal whatever they can reach.

After 10 rounds of combat, 10 members of the city guard will arrive from all sides led by Vanriel Glamfara. They are wielding clubs, and their threat of overwhelming force will put an end to the riot. If the party has already dealt with all rioters by that point without killing anyone, Vanriel will thank them and invite them back to her office. If the party used deadly force on the rioters, she will take them into custody for manslaughter. The kobolds and old man, if still alive, will also be taken into protective custody.

### Guard Captain Vanriel Glamfara

Vanriel is willing to answer the parties questions. If they are in custody, she will interrogate them each individually about their role in the riot, what happened, etc. She is relatively easy to convince that the party acted in self-defense. If they are not, then she will talk to them over dinner, a relatively meager affair of bread and cheese.

She will give the party what information she has on the goings on in town. She knows the locations of all the major landmarks in town. She knows the attacks by the undead happen quickest on the north side of town, and suspects the necromancers are hiding out in that direction. She is aware of the location of Sulac's Lair, but doesn't know anything else about him. She has no information on the orc army and it's proximity to the city, and is very concerned about the information the party has if they offer it.

She refuses to be taken into custody by the party, and claims (truthfully) that she was pardoned. If the party presses she will resist, aided by whatever guards are in the room with them.

##### [Run this Encounter](/runner/vanrielglamfara&guard&guard&guard&guard)

She asks the party to do the following things to enable the towns escape:

*   Deal with the necromancers that have been attacking travelers (see Necromancers on the Edge of Town).
*   Find a way to delay the Orc army (see Delay the Orc Army).
*   Find out from Malia Demonslayer what is needed to evacuate the refugees (see Evacuation of Northport).

She will pay their room and board at the Dragon's Brew while they are in town.

### The Dragon's Brew Inn

The Dragon's Brew, like every other inn in town, is packed, but rooms have been cleared out for the party by the proprietors, Ralf and Erestor. If the party is escorting Harwik Greenskin they will offer him their special safe room.

Ralf and Erestor are happy to converse with the party, offering adventuring stories, great food and the best beer in the world. They will interrogate the party about the availability of good beer in Cur'Estan, and actively consider relocating to the town since Northport isn't likely to last long. They ask the party to make sure to secure a decent wagon for the bar when evacuation time comes so that they can make sure to bring along their secret ingredients and brewing equipment.

Ralf and Erestor will also tell the party about any of the side quests they did not receive orders about previously, mentioning a rumor that the trollkin working with the orcs have not recently been paid, that the local druids have been showing up in the city looking for someone, that Allison Highwater, the Guild of Heroes guildmaster, is holed up in her chapter house refusing to leave, and that there is an ancient copper dragon west of town with a massive rumored horde. They do not bring up Biggles Wump unless asked. If asked they can point the way to his house.

### The Old Artificer

Biggles Wump has a house in town. He's a grumpy old gnome and refuses to open the door unless convinced. He will refuse to participate in the evacuation, and says the party, and the orcs, will get his old plans over his dead body. If the party gets inside the house, the house is filled with bookshelves covered in books of arcane plans for magical items and advanced gadgets.

Biggles sees Margo as an upstart kid who doesn't respect her elders, and is unconvinced by attempts to bring her into the picture. He is not frightened by the orcs or the prospect of being killed. He is done with life and only cares about not moving from his home.

The party will notice if they are conversing with Biggles that he is mostly blind, relying on massive spectacles to see at all, and his hearing is not great either. He will often ask them to repeat themselves, or misunderstand what they said (Biggles has disadvantage on all perception checks, is not proficient, and has a wisdom of 6).

Biggles also does have family in town, and will talk about them (at length) if asked (or if not asked). While his wife died years ago, his daughter, Giggles Wump, and grandkids live a few doors down and visit him often. He has photographs (taken with a camera of his own design) that he will pull out of one of the book shelves and insist on showing the party.

If the party talks to Giggles about her father's refusal to leave, she will agree to talk to him and will convince him to leave so that he can help his grandchildren escape.

## Sulac's Lair

#### Path to the dragon

The path to the dragon is a long winding upward sloping path, originally designed for carts to be carried up, back when the dragon still accepted offerings. Along the way there are six signs that read, in order:

1.  Danger! Dragon ahead, do not enter.
2.  No, seriously, real dragon ahead, do not enter.
3.  Real acid breathing dragon, actually real, will kill you.
4.  If you are seeking to kill the dragon, know that it is protected under Gerasilim law and attacking it is a felony punishable by 5 years in prison
5.  If you are seeking to talk to the dragon, know that it hates visitors and will not permit entry. It is also a dragon and will probably kill you
6.  Well you're here, the dragon is ahead, any chance to live past today is in the other direction. Choose wisely.

The Lair itself contains a series of traps that prevent access to the dragon.

#### First Trap

Before you is a giant pit that seems to disappear with how far down it is. There is a single rope ladder bridge that spans the pit. The bridge is useless, and is designed to throw people off as it only has a single anchor point on each end. Any character that uses the bridge must pass a DC 25 Dex check to cross or be tossed off the bridge. The dragon has set up a permanent feather fall spell in the pit, which funnels into a tunnel to drop off people at the base of the mountain with a sign that reads "don't come back."

#### Second Trap

Frictionless floor trap. A long hallway that is 10ft wide and 80ft long is stretched in front of you. There is a safe platform that is 5ft long before the trap begin, so that players can see their fate. The next 10ft is a pit trap that leads into the same feather fall tunnel as the previous trap, so that players can see the sign. After that is 40ft of obviously very smooth sleek metal surface. This surface is on the floor, walls and ceiling is completely frictionless. A player on the surface cannot stop or change direction or jump. After the 40ft of slip and slide is another 10ft long pit trap that again leads to the exit. There is then a 5ft platform for the players to land on. The back wall has an illusion of a wall 10ft before the actual wall, so attempts to shoot an arrow with a rope simply goes through the illusion. The back wall is slanted to prevent arrows from sticking in. The entire area is hallowed to prevent teleportation.

#### Third Trap

Man eating plants. The tunnel is filled with giant Venus fly trap like plants, that hide in brush and reach out to eat passerby's. The plants then attempt to forcibly teleport anyone they are eating via the transport via plants spell, it is a DC 14 charisma save to avoid this, and a DC 14 strength save to escape. Burning down the plants is a very bad idea however, as the plant matter burns a black smoke which fills the cavern, blinds them, suffocates them, and alerts the dragon to the party being complete morons. There is an obvious sign that says “Burn my garden and I’ll kill you”.

#### Fourth Trap

The final trap is just a programmed illusion of the dragon. It appears to be sleeping, whenever anyone wakes it up or speaks directly to it the illusion activates. It wakes up with a roar of fire into the air, then aggressively and continually threatens anyone that sticks around, talking over people and not listening to anything they are saying. The illusion also activates the dragons fear aura.

#### Victory

Eventually if they stick around the illusion resets, if the players are still there they can see the entrance to the dragons lair behind the illusion. There the dragon is actually sleeping, and is much more willing to talk.

Sulac is unwilling to help against the necromancers or to directly confront the orcs. He will reward the party with one random magic item from his horde. Sulac is willing to attack the orcs supply caravans for the party.

## The Druid's Grove

The local druid's regularly gather at a small grove just west of the city. Recently they have been making trips into the city itself looking for Elhavir Soras, who committed the crime of teaching an enemy of Gaian their secret language. Elhavir himself is hiding in the refugee camp at the Riverside Market, but he has eluded detection by the druid's thus far.

Player's who are not members of the Keeper's of the Grove may be alerted to this search by Erestor and Ralf at the Dragon's Brew.

If the players side with the druids and attempt to take Elhavir into custody, he will fight back, and if she learns of it, Vanriel will cease to provide help to the party. The druids will thank the party for their assistance on delivery of Elhavir, alive or dead, and give them a wand of cure wounds in payment. If alerted to the proximity of the orc army by the players the druids will leave, scattering to the winds.

##### [Run this Encounter](/runner/elhavirsoras)

If the player's ask for the druid's assistance they can aid in delaying the orc army, using wild animals to harry the orcs supply lines. This results in a net delay of 1 day for every 5 days of travel the orcs have yet to make.

If the player's side with Elhavir he will ask to be taken to Vanriel so she can smuggle him out of town. He will give them a Wand of Detect Magic as a reward. Two of the druid's (use NPC entry from the Monster Manual for Druid) will intercept the party on their way to the City Guard's headquarters and attack them assisted by 3 giant spiders (attacking from the rooftops) and 2 giant eagles.

##### [Run this Encounter](/runner/druid&druid&giantspider&giantspider&giantspider&gianteagle&gianteagle)

## Backstory Encounters

#### Carlyle Part 1

While in the city, Flykr will be approached by a peasant named Phil, walking with a disjointed step, a raven on his shoulder.  He will, with a pained expression,
and as if resisting the impulse, hand her a letter.  The letter states:

My Dearest Flykr,

I am in pieces with grief over my recent lack of communication.  Finding a decent courier to communicate my undying devotion to you has been a trial. I hoped to meet you here in Northport, but circumstances
demand most of my mind be concentrated elsewhere. Nevertheless I think of you regularly.  The gentleman who has delivered this letter on my behalf has a token for you, a small piece of what I hope will one
day be a grand token of our undying devotion to eachother. You need but ask him for it. I pray that it can keep you from harm until we meet again.

Forever Yours,
Carlyle

If asked he will hand over the first piece of the Carlyle sword (identified simply as 'blade shard necklace'), again, unwillingly.

#### Rival Party

The rival party will enter town on the backs of glamoured horses, and to much acclaim.  The party will see them, but they will not make eye contact with the party. They will
declare loudly that they are looking for criminals on the run from the law, name the party members by name, and begin handing out flyers with their pictures on it (including
Tilda as a woman, not as Fallon). The flyers read:

WANTED! The noble party of Jazelle, Barry, Bartok Wailmane, Maggie Pelagius, Yostisli Granitebrand, and Herad Paleleaf are seeking wanted criminals on behalf of 
High Lord Slithers. The parties below are wanted in connection to various crimes committed in Kandor, Eldoran, Gerasalim, Dormania, and elsewhere. All are wanted
dead or alive except the child Adam, who is to be brought back alive so he may be returned to his family.

##### Tilda
Murder of the High Duke of Westport
kidnapping
theft
lying to an officer of the law

##### Adam
theft
fraud
smuggling

##### Barbarious
assault
murder
espionage
theft
kidnapping

##### Silas of Irons
assault
espionage
kidnapping

##### Eobard Thawne
murder
kidnapping

##### Flykr Moon
theft
fraud
kidnapping

If confronted, the rival party will get the crowd to attack the party for them, and slip away.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/jazelle&barry&bartokwailmane&maggiepelagius&yostisligranitebrand&heradpaleleaf)

#### Samvel

Tilda's brother, Samvel, will whisper to Tilda from a nearby alley. He offers to hide the party in his house nearby. He honestly wants to help, however he can offer little
besides immediate shelter, and reassurance that Malia and Vanriel have little patience for bounty hunters. He is happy to see Tilda, and will go along with her deceptions
if brought into the loop (but does not know her as Fallon otherwise). He is not very good at lying (+2 deception), but will hold to the story if caught in a lie.

#### Herad Paleleaf and Yostisli Granitebrand

Some short time later, Herad Paleleaf and Yostisli Granitebrand will approach the party alone and ask to speak with Silas and Barbarious. They will offer them a deal: bring 
them Adam and renounce the Masters of the Deep Song and they'll have their part in the whole affair expunged, they can walk away without issue. He tries to convince him that
it is the right thing to do, since Adam is so young and ran away from home. He just wants to get Adam back to his family. Yostisli will say that Barbarious presence in the 
Masters is an affront to the order, and if he refuses she will feel duty bound to hunt him down and kill him.

#### Erik Dawnblade

If Silas enquires about Erik Dawnblade in town, a reasonable investigation check will reveal that he was in Northport roughly a month ago, but headed east and hasn't been
seen since.

## Necromancers on the Edge of Town

For the past several months everyone trying to leave the city has been attacked by undead. Any time the players leave the city they will be attacked by undead within an hour (see Undead Raid in the random encounter section of this chapter).

Whatever attacks them, they leave relatively obvious tracks that lead back to the necromancers camp.

### The Necromancer's Camp

The necromancers have been harassing the town for a good two months now, and are well set in. Though their camp is out in the open, and does not have the benefit of predicting where attacks may come from. The necromancers believe they will be able to deal with any threat that shows up, and have set up traps to simply alert them to intruders. Once an alarm is raised, the necromancers spend a minute to create a huge skeleton to aid them against the incoming forces.

#### Zombie Moat

The encampment is surrounded by a ditch that is 15ft wide and 20ft deep (dug by zombies). The zombies that dug out the pit are still in it (14 total, and armed with shovels). The zombies also start growling at people they see, which alert the rest of the camp.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie)

#### Patrols

These patrols travel in groups of 3, 1 wight and 2 skeletons armed with heavy crossbows. Players can expect to see at least 3 such groups randomly patrolling. One of the skeletons in the group has a bell, and will ring it loudly (as an action) when it see intruders. These skeletons join together to fight intruders if the alarm is raised, and will notice if the zombies in the pit start making noise.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/wight&skeleton&skeleton)

#### Watch Towers

5 wooden watch towers have been set up within the camp. Each tower is 30 ft. high with a single ladder that leads to an upper platform. The upper platform has half walls that provide partial cover. On top of each tower is 4 skeletons with heavy crossbows. These towers are positioned equidistant from one another (50 ft apart) and give a full circle of watch. The skeletons are quite dumb however, and only sound the alarm and attack if humans approach. A simple disguise, a large shrub, or a blanket could make the skeletons not bother attacking.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/skeleton&skeleton&skeleton&skeleton)

#### Ogre Zombie Pits

Similar to the first trap, there are sporadically zombie pits hidden in the area. A player that isn’t paying attention has an 80% chance of walking into a pit, and must make a DC 12 Dex Save or fall into a pit with an Ogre Zombie at the bottom. The necromancers have walked through the camp enough to know where the pits are by heart, and a DC 13 survival check reveals the paths that the necromancers have worn down (triggered automatically, no need for the player to guess at having to do one.). Alternately a passive perception of 16 or higher will notice any pits within 15 ft of a player automatically.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/ogrezombie)

#### Tortured Citizens

Some of the people from the town, those that attempted escape or attempted to fight the necromancers are chained to posts in the inner area of the camp. Each of these
people are trapped with a glyph of warding, if the person is removed by some daring hero, the hero and the hostage explode for 5d8 thunder damage (DC 14 Constitution
save for half). This creates a loud booming sound that alerts the skeleton patrols and the necromancers. The citizens are unconscious and have level 5 exhaustion
(speed of 0). If given water or food some of them can mention that the necromancers did some magic thing to the pole they are chained to, but are not aware what it does.
The rune itself is obvious, and a DC 15 arcana check will identify it's effect.

#### Noisemakers

Lastly near the center of their camp the necromancers have set up noisemakers in the form of a curtain of bones on strings. The curtain entirely surrounds the camp, and there is no clear entrance. The noise maker simply makes rattling which alerts the skeleton patrols, and gives the necromancers enough time to summon their giant skeleton.

#### Necromancer's Tent

Inside the tent are the necromancers. Ironically, they don’t like to have undead in the room with them, and instead just a big piles of bones in a chest, along with anything else they may need.

## The Guild of Heroes

#### Entering the guild

The guild is already abandoned. Nothing of value is left and nobody is around. In the center area there is a trap door that has been left open, and players can vaguely hear somebody talking to herself. Below in the trap door is Allison Highwater who is currently trying to insert two keys into two different slots on different sides of the room at the same time by throwing chairs. Players can easily convince her to help the cause if they help her open the door. She stresses that all of the magic items stored inside are evil and dangerous.

#### Room 1: Monster Trap

The first room has a hydra in it that is loose but cannot escape through the door they came in as it closes behind the players. The guild leader assures the players that the hydra is well trained and will not attack them. The players enter the room and the hydra attacks. After the hydra is defeated (the guild leader wants it taken alive), the leader will explain that she has a ring that is supposed to calm it, but forgot it.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/hydra&allisonhighwater)

#### Room 2: Mirror Room

When they enter this room it has full length mirrors along the walls. Once the players are in the room the mirrors cast Simulacrum from each player, creating a snow clone 
of each one that they have to fight. The clones only have half of their HP, but all of their abilities.

##### [Run This Encounter](/runner/silasclone&flykrclone&fallonclone&eobardclone&barbariousclone&adamclone)

#### Room 3: Cursed Treasure

The next room is filled with hundreds of thousands of gold, gems, jewelry, amazing weapons and armor. The guild leader simply says “don’t touch it” and moves forward without a glance behind her. Everything in the room mimicks. All of it, everything, its mimicks all they way down. They are kept in a stupor by the guild and only awaken when touched.

##### [Mimic](/runner/mimic&mimic&mimic&mimic&allisonhighwater)

#### Room 4: Riddles that Aren't Meant to be Solved

In this room a door gives each person a question that must be answered. The trick of it, that the guild leaders tell them, is that they must give the wrongest answer possible. When the right answer is given, a spout of fire shoots down from the ceiling. The person answering the riddle must make a DC 15 dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success. Some example riddles are in the table below:

<table class="table table-striped">
<thead><tr><th>Riddle</th><th>Correct Answer</th><th>Answer that Opens the Door</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>What falls down but never up?</td><td>Rain</td><td>Helium.</td></tr>
<tr><td>What has a foot but no legs?</td><td>Snail</td><td>Millipede</td></tr>
<tr><td>If I drink, I die. If i eat, I am fine. What am I?</td><td>Fire</td><td>The Ocean</td></tr>
<tr><td>What starts with the letter “t”, is filled with “t” and ends in “t”?</td><td>teapot</td><td>Air</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Room 5: Overly Complex Puzzle Room

This room is impossible to solve without having known the answer ahead of time, and is super deadly. The guild leader handles this one herself.

#### Room 6: Treasure Room

Within the room is a dozen different magical barriers to prevent scrying, wishes, or teleportation. Here the guild leader uses mage hand to put the magical artifacts 
into a bag of holding saying they are all dangerous and need to be kept out of enemys hands, or any hands for that matter. She mentions the Cora weapon and says the 
party can have it if they want, it’s a dumb weapon anyways. The artifact she gives the party is Luna, the Sword of Limitless Hope (if the Champion of Cora in the 
party does not wield a sword, subsitute an appropriate weapon type, such as a crossbow, longbow, mace, etc)

With the issue dealt with, Allison will be able to help the party on one other task (such as fighting the Necromancers, delaying the orc army, getting to Sulac, etc), 
and will leave Northport with the refugees.

  <h4>The Time Egg (wondrous item, legendary)</h4>
  <p>
    The Time Egg is a powerful artifact of Amathera, when the egg is held and the proper command word spoken, the user is brought back in time to wherever they were 24 hours 
    before, their memory intact of all that transpired during the previous iteration of that time. They then are able to relive that day, changing what they do, potentially
    undoing a catastrophic mistake, or intervening in an event that they previously had no way to foresee. Unfortunately the egg also has a horrible side effect preventing
    frivolous use.  After the 24 hours has elapsed, the mind of the user collapses on itself and they die instantly.

<aside>
  <h4>The Barrier Crystal (wondrous item, legendary, attunement)</h4>
  <p>
    This crystal is a fragment of the Arcanum crystal that separates the material plane from the remainder of the multiverse, and is the combination of two barrier crystals.
    This crystal now serves the function of both of the two smaller crystals, and manipulating it connects one both to the abyss, and to the mysterious plane of the creature
    known as 'ME'. As soon as you touch the crystal, the entities beyond it become aware of you. The demons immediately use it to steal some of your lifeforce to open the
    briefest of portals to the material plane, causing a random demon to appear within 30 ft of you. This demon obeys your commands, so long as those commands serve the
    greater goals of its demonic lord, such as causing chaos, destruction, and murder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, when you touch the crystal the creature 'ME' attempts to take control of your mind. Make a DC 20 Charisma save. If you fail, you lose control of yourself, as
    if under the affects of dominate monster, however you do not get additional saves. If the remove curse or greater restoration spell is cast on you, you can attempt the
    save again. While under the affects of the crystal, you work tirelessly to serve the inscrutable interests of 'ME'.

  <h4>The Book of Vile Darkness</h4>
  <p>
    Anyone that attempts to read this book by proxy, such as scrying, using a familiar, using a mind controlled person, or any similar magic, will find the words to slip 
    away from their sight and be illegible. If a person willfully focuses and attempts to read the book, they must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw. On a success, they 
    realize the book is trying to influence their mind, but can still willfully read the book. On a failure, the person gains the flaw of “This book is the solution to 
    all my problems, to answer to my prayers, and I was destined to have it.”. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you finish reading the book, you become attuned to it. Once attuned, your alignment becomes evil, and must remain so to keep the knowledge and benefits of the 
    book. A person attuned to the book may not actively participate in an act of good, and must commit an evil act at least once every 10 days, or the book shall work to 
    find a worthier host.
  </p>
  <p>
    The book of vile darkness cannot be destroyed by any normal means. A good angelic being or deity which destroys the book causes the book to 
    disappear for 1d100 years, before the book reforms. If the book is lost and un-attuned it will subtly manipulate events to better increase the chances of it being 
    found. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The very presence of the book seems to seep evil into the surrounding area. The book causes plants to wither and die if near the book for more than 1 day.
  </p>
  <p>
    While attuned you gain the following benefits:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You increase either your intelligence or charisma by 4, to a max of 24.</li>
    <li>Your Wisdom decreases by 2, to a min of 6.</li>
    <li>A burn mark appears on the back of your left hand, marking you as the owner of the book. The mark is of Azreal, the angel of death, in the shape of a slice 
      cutting through a formless soul. You can reveal this mark to another intelligent evil creature to gain advantage on persuasion, deception or intimidation checks
      against them, as all evil creatures understand the marks importance, even if they do not understand its meaning.</li>
    <li>You lose any connection to any neutral or good divine/powerful beings. You must re-spec any levels of cleric or paladin to another available class, or take the 
      oath-breaker paladin class track.</li>
    <li>You can cast the following spells once a day each without material components and without expending a spell slot: Animate dead (at the 5th level), 
      Create undead, speak with dead, dance macabre, feign death, and harm. You use either Charisma or Intelligence as your casting modifier for these spells.</li>
    <li>You add the following spells to your list of known and prepared spells. The spells do not count against your number of prepared spells, and the spells are 
      forgotten if you unattuned from the book.</li>
  </ul>

    moment and beckon the creature to the afterlife. Constructs are immune. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is 
    missing more than half of its hitpoints, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage. The spells damage increases by one die when you reach 5 th level (2d8 or 2d12), 
    11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

  <p>
    You also learn to summon more powerful undead by channeling energy from the negative elemental plane directly.

  <h4>Black Razor (weapon, rapier, legendary, attunement)</h4>
  <p>
    A Rapier that shines like a piece of the night sky filled with stars. It’s black scabbard is decorated in a similar manner. The sword is designed to function similar to

    dwarves. It seeks to destroy all who are not dwarves, especially orc and goblinoids, and wants to protect dwarves at all cost. Whelm forms a psychic connect with it
    wielder; if its wielder acts in way contrary to Whelm desires, Whelm may refuse to grant the wielder its abilities, or Whelm may attempt to take control of its 
    wielder for a short time. The Save DC to resist Whelm is 16.

  <h4>Luna, The Sword of Limitless Hope (Weapon, greatsword, legendary, attunement)</h4>
  <p>
    The Sword of Limitless Hope was forged by Cora herself as a gift to her greatest champion during the Neran Cataclysm. Used to strike down the Lich King of Nerim, the 
    sword was believed lost, with occasional rumors of it appearing in a dragon’s horde, or a beholder’s dungeon. The Guild of Heroes discovered it during a routine 
    contract, and hoping to take advantage of the obviously magical sword, attuned to it without researching its capabilities first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luna is sentient, and will only allow devout followers of Cora to attune to her. Her intelligence is 12, wisdom is 10 and charisma is 20\. Luna speaks telepathically 
    with someone who is attuned to her, but is silent for all others. She has darkvision and can hear normally for 60 ft., beyond which she is blind and deaf.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luna refuses to retreat in the face of her enemies, and will resist any attempt to leave enemies undefeated, or to act dishonorably. Additionally, she believes 
    strongly that all undead must be destroyed and if she hears of any necromancers or undead nearby she will insist they be destroyed immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Curse:</strong> Anyone who attempts to attune to Luna who is not a devout follower of Cora immediately loses control of the sword, which gains a fly speed 
    of 30 ft. and focuses only on attacking them. These attacks have a +7 to hit, dealing 2d6+5 slashing damage. This effect can be ended by the remove curse spell, 
    ending the attunement.

## Druid's Revenge

If the party saves kills the druids who attempted to take Elhavir, the rival party will work with the Druids to attempt to ambush and kill the party. A messenger will approach the party with a note. The note says:

We have successfully secured the medicine necessary to save the town. Meet us at the large oak tree west of town and we'll hand it over.

It is in fact a trap, but the medicine is there, sitting in a cart next to the tree, the local leader of the druid's circle waiting there. Two of his compatriots are wildshaped into squirrels in the tree, and after a brief conversation, they all will attack.

## Delay the Orc Army

The Orc army is travelling 15 miles a day towards Northport from the south. Potentially leaving very little time to evacuate the refugees. Vanriel and Malia will both 
suggest finding ways to delay the orcs after the necromancers are dealt with. There are a number of ways to delay the orcs, detailed below.

#### Recruit Sulac to attack the supply caravans

Sulac can easily lay waste to the lightly defended orc supply chain. Recruiting him to do so will delay the orcs by 3 days as they are forced to spend time stripping the 
countryside for food. **Delays by 3 days**

#### Burn bridges

There is one bridge the orcs need to cross for every 45 miles of travel they still need to reach Northport. For each bridge burned, the orcs are delayed by 1/2 a day. 
**Delay 1 day for every 6 remaining**

#### Recruit the guard to raid their supplies

The city guard could attempt a raid on the orcs supplies, stealing wagons, food, and medicine. They would be likely to take heavy casualties, but a successful raid would 
delay the orcs by 3 days. **Delay by 3 days, does not stack with Sulac**

#### Create False Forces

The orcs could be forced to slow down if they had to be more careful about potential attack. We could probably slow them down by about a 1/3 if we planted false fires or 
other appearances of opposing forces along their route. **Delay by 1 day per 3 remaining**

#### Infiltrate and Kill Leaders

Orc armies typically require strongarm leaders to move efficiently. If you can get into the camp and kill the warlord in charge, you should delay them by at least a few 
days while they squabble over who is in charge. **Delays by 4 days**

##### Notes on running the camp infiltration

* Anyone who does not appear orcish/goblinoid that is seen is attacked by orcs & goblins, 4 additional ones per round until the encounter is resolved (either through death, capture, or escape). Roll D100 4 times and consult the table below to determine what attacks.
* Stealth checks to avoid detection while moving through the camp have a DC of 18. The DC of deception checks to maintain a disguise when challenged is 16.
* The Orc Warlord's tent is at the center of the camp. There are 5 warlords who nominally run the army, 4 brigadier generals and a high commander, Warlord Catrus. The party need only kill the high commander to cause chaos in the camp, the other three would then fight each other for control of the army. The commander has 2 Elite Guards who stay with him most of the time, and functionaries come in and out of his tent pretty regularly on various business. While he ocasionally leaves his tent, while in his tent is the only time you can catch him with just his guards. [Run This Encounter](/runner/warlordcratus)
* Warlord Cratus will always detect any PCs that enter his tent via an Arcane Eye that has been following the party. As they enter he shimmers, and suddenly there are two of them (one is an illusion). He also summons his force weapon, a longsword made of pure force.

## Evacuation of Northport

Malia Demonslayer has a number of things she needs to evacuate the refugees. While some refugees would be able to leave as soon as the necromancers are dealt with, for most to survive to Cur'Estan additional supplies are needed.

<table class="table table-striped">
<thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Needs</th><th>Food Req.</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Wealthy and Able</td><td>Necromancer threat dealt with</td><td>0 person days (self feed)</td></tr>
<tr><td>City Guard</td><td>Convince Vanriel to abandon the city, poor evacuation conditions met</td><td>20,000 person days (or 10,000 person days if they take heavy casualties)</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>

#### Hand Carts

Hand-drawn supply carts would allow the strong and able to pull with them food and other supplies for their families. Children would be able to ride in the carts pulled by their parents.

Supply carts can be obtained in the following ways:

*   If the players visit the Orc army and deliver the Trollkin's orders, the Trollkin will be willing to sell their supply carts to Malia for cheap (this subtracts 1 day from the necessary construction time of the other options).
*   Have the refugees build them themselves (takes 1 week of time).
*   Organize the towns skilled tradesmen to build them (takes 3 days of time)
*   Have at least 100 wagons (enough space to no longer need supply carts)

#### Food

The city is already running out of food, and does not have enough to feed everyone for the journey. They would need enough food to feed the people for 40 days, and currently have 200,000 person days of spare food.

Extra food can be obtained in the following ways:

*   Have the city guard attempt to raid the orc army and steal their supply wagons (would lead to heavy casualties among the guard, 50% chance Vanriel dies), acquire 100,000 person days of food.
*   Conscript the local druids to join on the trip and create food (10,000 person days).
*   Conscript the remaining clerics from all of the towns temples to join the trip and create food. Clerics from each temple will be able to provide the following amount of food:
    *   Alohim: 10,000 person days
    *   Amathera: 0 days worth (already fully committed)
    *   Cora: 15,000 person days
    *   Dorman: 5,000 person days
    *   Maris: 1,500 person days
    *   Sara: 30,000 person days (wands of create food and water)
*   Have the refugees help the local farmers strip the fields (provide 20,000 person days extra food per day, cannot start until necromancers dealt with)

#### Wagons

Transporting the sick and elderly will require better than just hand carts. Given their numbers, to transport them all we will need at least 50 or so horse or ox drawn wagons.

Wagons can be obtained in the following ways.

*   Have the refugees attempt to construct the wagons (takes 2 weeks of time for 50 wagons, or 4 weeks of time for 100 wagons).
*   Have the towns skilled tradesmen build them (takes 1 week of time for 50 wagons, or 2 weeks of time for 100 wagons).
*   Have the city guard attempt to raid the orc army and steal their supply wagons (would lead to heavy casualties among the guard, 50% chance Vanriel dies), obtain 100 wagons.

#### Medicine

Medicine for the sick is in short supply. There are two ways to obtain medicine:

*   Convince the local druids to supply medicine by spending their time on the journey scouring the woods for herbs.
*   Steal the orcs medicine supplies.

#### Convince Vanriel to Abandon the City

Vanriel will be absolutely unwilling to leave the city if the majority of the populace still remains, so for the guard to leave there must be enough resources for the poor to leave town and the necromancers must be dealt with. If there are not enough resources for the sick and elderly she must be persuaded to leave (DC 20 charisma persuasion check). If there are enough resources for everyone to leave town she will leave without needing convincing.

#### Assault on the Refugee Caravan

The Orc army, realizing their trap has failed, will make a last ditch attempt to stop the refugees for escaping, detaching a unit to move double time and intercept the refugee caravan.

The party can aid in the defense, however they are only a small part of the overall defense. If the city guard has suffered severe casualties, they will be nearly wiped out by the attack and there will be a 50% chance that Vanriel dies in that case. Additionally 500 refugees will parish in the attack in that case.

The party will be confronted with a contingent of orcs.
