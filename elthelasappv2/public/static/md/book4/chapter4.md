# Chapter 4. Behind Enemy Lines

Thanks to your efforts we finally have an army that stands a chance against the orcish forces in Northern Gerasalim. Our first goal with that army is to retake the city of Northport. To do that we want to force the orcish army to withdraw back to Strovenguard. I believe if we can force the orcish warlords in Strovenguard to start fighting amongst themselves the warlords in the main army will have to return to reestablish order. Go to Strovenguard, and find a way to force a conflict. Be careful, anyone in Strovenguard right now who isn't an orc is either a slave, or dead.

#### Black Wolf Irregulars

Queen Organa had a secret treasury hidden in her palace, enough platinum hidden away to make a difference in this war, and she has asked us to retreive it for her. It will likely be more than you can carry, but this gem once activated will teleport anything within 10 ft of it back here.

#### Inevitables

We have heard of a time traveler who has built a dungeon in the sewers of Strovenguard. Do not engage him for now, but explore this hidden lair and find out where he came from.

#### Sylvan's Rangers

Drorull Spine-Axe is known to be especially cruel to his slaves, even for an orc. Make sure he dies for his atrocities.

#### Union of Wizards Colleges

The lengendary gnome Transmuter Jim Jimmy Jim Jim is rumored to be in Strovenguard, find him and bring him back to Cur'Estan. Fair warning, he has been touched by otherworldly beings and may not be entirely sane, but his knowledge of the far realms must be preserved.

## Strovenguard

<img src='https://elthelas-images.herokuapp.com/maps/cities/strovenguard.png' class="col-sm-12" />

Strovenguard is an occupied city. The Orcs forced the queen to abandon her capitol a few months ago, and most of the cities population is now officially enslaved by one warlord or another. Three orc's have been assigned as overseers for the town, officially gaining 'Warlord' status as a result, and have partitioned the town into thirds. The alliance between the warlords is tenuous, and the sections operate mostly autonomously. Humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, or halflings who do not have a slave brand are considered outlaws by the orcs, and fair game for whomever can capture them.

#### Major Locations in Strovenguard

#### 1\. Royal Palace of Gerasalim

The Royal Palace is in fact an imposing and sprawling fortress built at the conflux of the Ara river and Saria Lake. Once the poliitcal center for Gerasalim, it has been repurposed by the orcs as a staging base and military center.

#### 2\. Maris Island Fortress

Maris Island Fortress guards the road to the north and is in charge of enforcing tolls and taxation on the river mouth bridges and ships passing from the lake to the river.

#### 3\. River Docks and Warehouses

The River Docks extend away from Memorial Square in both directions along the riverfront and lake shore. A wide boardwalk separates the piers from the various warehouse buildings. The warehouses are now all used by the warlords to coordinate food supplies, both for the city, and to be shipped upriver to the army.

#### 4\. Temple of Maris

The Temple of Maris is abandoned and stripped of anything of value by the orcs, but the stone beds used by the priests, and the Teleportation Circle used as a system of revenue, remains. As the players leave the temple for the first time, there are a pair of orc guards tasked with searching for escaped slaves who are surprised by them. The Orcs, seeing the party is well armed, are willing to let them go on their way.

#### 5\. Beren Brewery

The last functioning brewery in Strovenguard after the invasion, it is being used to supply the local garrison with beer. Currently running at only a fraction of its normal capacity due to a lack of skilled labor.

#### 6\. Memorial Square

The area around the royal palace is a large paved square extending a quarter mile out from the palace on all sides, where traditionally a stand-up market took place every morning. Permanent structures were banned for defense reasons. Today the square is mostly empty except for the odd beggar, and orcs passing into and out of the palace. Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim, disguised as a beggar, spends his time in the square most days, where he plans his next daring plan to free slaves from the city.

#### 7\. North Town

This unfortified northern suburb of Strovenguard lies beyond the river and is currently officially abandoned. However it has become a haven for escaped slaves attempting to evade the orcs.

#### 8\. Old Town

The central Old Town district is the original city built by Dorman I. It is laid out in neat orderly rows of city blocks with designated green space every 4th block.

#### 9\. New Town: Military District

The Military District is dominated by what used to be living quarters for soldiers and officers, as well as people involved in trades and services specialized towards such customers.

#### 10\. New Town: Factory District

The eastern portion of New Town is dominated by manufacturies and artisans.

### Important People in Strovenguard

#### [Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim](/runner/jimjimmyjimjimjim)

Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim is in Strovenguard, and once in the city he is not hard to find. Every one in town knows of him because he spends every day just outside the gates of the palace ranting at anyone who passes by and generally making a nuisance of himself. He has so far avoided unwanted attention by the orcs, but no one is really sure how since the castle is their base of operations and presumably they pass by him constantly.

Jim started out his career as a transmuter, until he was touched by the otherworldly force known as Me (now the goddess Area). Her touch caused him to get visions of different places and times, often uncontrollably, but over time he has gained more control over the visions. Very few are aware that he is anything but a crazy old gnome.

Jim is not willing to help the party. He will rebuff them initially. In order to get him to help, the players can pursue a few strategies:

**Blackmail:** Jim is a wanted man by the orcs, (there are wanted posters with his face on it all over town). If the players threaten to turn him in he will relent to help.

**Bribery:** Jim is amenable to bribery. He is particularly interested in transmutation spell scrolls or wands (can be bought from Margo).

**Persuasion:** Jim sees himself as a protector of the material plane from otherworldly forces, and is amenable to arguments that he would be helping protect the world from extraplanar entities such as the Prince of Fiends.

If convinced to help, Jim will attempt to scry on what the players ask him to, but only 1 thing per day.

#### [Warlord Rol The Unsightly](/runner/roltheunsightly)

Rol the Unsightly is the Warlord in charge of the old city of Strovenguard, and thus has possession of the Queen's castle. He is a known drunkard, and is irritable at the inability to get the local breweries up and running properly. He has been taking out his anger on his subordinates.

Rol spends most of his time hiding out in his personal quarters in the Royal Palace, he is typically alone except when he wants to rail against one or more of his subordinates.

#### [Warlord Drorull Spine-Axe](/runner/drorullspineaxe)

Warlord Spine-Axe is in control of the new city, and thus the breweries. He has denied the other warlords access to the little beer that is produced, hording it for his own men. He is aware of Rol's drinking problem, and sees it as a way to slight his rival who managed to secure the superior acquisition of the old city.

Drorull stays in an old manor house in the city, where he regularly holds audience and keeps a direct hand in the affairs of the city.

#### [Warlord Zhuk the Miscreant](/runner/zhukthemiscreant)

Warlord Zhuk is in control of North Town, north of the Ara river, a very minor award considering most of the residents of North Town managed to flee before the orcs arrived, and thus he gained few slaves from the apportionment.

Zhuk is constantly paranoid that the other warlords will attack him or cut off food supplies to his men, and has forced his men onto half rations so that he can stockpile goods 'just in case'. He has also been building new fortifications around the previously unfortified North Town, dedicating every slave he does manage to capture to the task. His men have been running secret raids into the New City to try to steal slaves from Drorull Spine-Axe.

Zhuk has made his home at Maris Island Fortress, the only fortified portion of his territory, where he regularly surrounds himself with guards.

### Assassinate the Warlords

#### Rol the Unsightly

Rol is in the Royal Palace, for details on how to find and assassinate Rol the Unsightly see 'The Castle of the Queen'.

#### Zhuk the Miscreant

Zhuk is in Maris Island Fortress, where he surrounds himself with guards. Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim, if the party is stuck, will suggest pretending to be an emissary in order to get to him. Zhuk is desparate for allies, and will even entertain the thought of betraying the orc nation, if not particularly seriously. He will not, however, keep up his side of any deal he makes and will betray anyone who makes a deal with him at the first opportunity.

#### Maris Island Fortress

Maris Island Fortress has existed for some time as an enforcement location for tolls and taxes. It sits on an island at the mouth of the Ara River, with a fortified bridge going to either shore. When entering the castle from the city you enter via the south gate into room 1 below. When the players are attempting to learn about the fortress the following pieces of information are available:

* No one uses the south gate anymore, it's barely even guarded.
* Most of the servants go in and out via a servants entrance by the kitchens, the gate is kept locked though.
* The north gate is usually open, but is guarded pretty heavily.
* Zhuk is paranoid, and keeps his guards close.  Getting him alone is all but impossible.
* Zhuk is desparate for allies against the other warlords, especially since he betrayed his brother to get the position he has and no one trusts him anymore.

##### 1. The South Entryway

The South Entryway is not actively guarded on the inside, but Zhuk uses it for a display of power, the bodies of recently executed criminals have been put on display here, some with their heads on pikes, others chained to the wall. A hole in the cieling leads to room 5, where the guards keep watch. The gate is made of wood and kept locked with a heavy chain and padlock. The guards in the gatehouse above have the key.  The south door into the keep proper is trapped with a pressure plate that will cause a spray of fire to shoot out hitting targets within 15 feet of the door for 4d10 fire damage (DC 13 dex save for half).

##### a. Gatehouse Stairs.

These stairs lead up from the South Entryway into the related gatehouse.

##### 2. Kitchens.

The castle kitchens are regularly filled with servants and cooks bustling in and out, most of which are human or halfling slaves. The north door is a small servants entrance that is kept locked, but one of the servants will open it for those who know the passphrase: 'Bagel muffins'. Anyone on staff knows the pass phrase, including the slaves, and most can be bribed to give it up, or a sneaky character may be able to overhear it in use as the door is regularly used by servants bringing in supplies.

##### 3. Old Store Room.

This store room hasn't been used in some time. It is filled with barrels of long rotted fruit.

##### 4. Kitchen Pantry.

One of two pantries associated with the castle kitchens, the servants often use the corridor behind the pantry to sneak a nap.

##### 5. South Gatehouse.

Guarded by a Blade of Ilneval and 4 orc troopers, they try to avoid going downstairs if they can.

<p><strong><a href='/runner/orcbladeofilneval&orc&orc&orc&orc)' target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 6. Inner Trap Room.

Once a cloak room for visitors, Zhuk has converted this room into a deathtrap. The south door is locked, and shoots a magic missile at anyone who touches it for 2d10 force damage. Their is a 5 foot platform on the north end of the room, and another one at the south end. Between the two, the floor has been dug out and poisoned spikes placed at the bottom. A rope bridge has been set up between the two platforms that is intentionally built to collapse as soon as someone steps on it.

##### 7. Barracks.

This room is filled with beds for the various guards who live in the keep. Since Zhuk is paranoid and keeps as many of his guards as possible as close as possible, the room is packed with orc soldiers, 18 of them at the present time (all just average grunts). Most do not have weapons on them, rather their weapons are on weapon racks around the room (one on each wall). Several of them are playing dice, a few others sleeping, a couple of them eating dinner, etc.

##### 8. Great Hall.

Zhuk is typically in the Great Hall, with his 6 elite guards. All of the doors are kept locked and trapped, with disable switches from inside the hall. Anyone who attempts to pick the lock or break down a door gets sprayed with acid for 6d4 acid damage (DC 13 Dex save for half).

##### 9. Old Treasure Room.

This room (behind a secret door in the old store room) has not been discovered by the orcs. It used to be used to store the toll collections, and 5000 GP was left behind here when the fortress was abandoned.

##### 10. Kitchen Pantry 2.

The south kitchen pantry, where the rare and expensive ingredients are stored. The door is trapped and locked and only the head chef has the key. The trap is a simple arrow trap (+5 to hit, 1d8 damage). Inside are a number of rare alchemical ingredients worth 500 gp.

##### 11. Soldiers Dining Room.

An old eating room for the soldiers. Their are still a couple of tables with chairs, but the orcs don't use it.

##### 12. North gatehouse.

This room has 3 Elite Guards who make sure no one who isn't allowed enters the Great Hall.

<p><strong><a href="/runner/orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orceliteguard" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 13. Extended Barracks.

This room has been converted into additional barracks space, with sleeping pallets all around the room. It has 10 guards in it currently.

##### 14. Abandoned Courtyard.

This inner courtyard is no longer used.

##### 15. North Cloakroom.

This room is an unused cloakroom.

##### 16. Vault.

This room was once a bedroom for a minor functionary, Zhuk, not knowing where the original vault was, has converted it into a vault for collected tolls and taxes. It has 10,000 GP and 3 random uncommon magic items confiscated from captured slaves. The door has been replaced with a heavy iron vault door, however the frame is still made of wood and can be relatively easily broken out.

##### 17. Vault Guardroom.

This room is magically darkened, with 4 Red Fangs of Shargaas hiding in the darkness, waiting to strike at anyone who enters without permission.

<p><strong><a href="/runner/orcredfangofshargaas&orcredfangofshargaas&orcredfangofshargaas&orcredfangofshargaas" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 18. Guard's Secret Room

This secret room used to be used as a hangout by guards in the know. There are empty kegs, card tables and some bare cupboards. The corpses of three guards who hid in here when the orcs attacked are huddled in the corner, having starved to death.

##### 19. Servant's Living Quarters

This large living space was used by the castle staff before the orc invasion. It has been converted into a general slave quarters by the orcs. The kitchen, dining tables, and bookshelves that were there originally still remain, but now there are makeshift beds scattered around the room as well.
