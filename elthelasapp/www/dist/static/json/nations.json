It was not long before hordes of demons began to pour through the portal. They marched relentlessly out of the portal in ever greater numbers. Whenever they found human habitation they would murder the men and children, burn everything to the ground, rape those women they desired, and send them onward to tell the tale. It was not long before the horde stood at the gates of Dera itself. Those people who had not already fled were slaughtered. It was just after the burning of the great city that Bahamut intervened. The Dragon God led the metallic dragons from all over the world against the demon horde and drove them back. Finally closing the portal through which they had come. Those demons that survived fled to the western mountains where many remain to this day. Bahamut brought the survivors of Dera to Vasha and Vashna, then small towns and left one of his greatest warriors to rule over them. They renamed their land Dera'Dragorim in honor of the sacrifice the dragons gave for them and took up the worship of Bahamut.\n\nSince then Dera'Dragorim has grown in wealth and prosperity.

Eventually the elves controlled as much territory on the mainland continent as elsewhere.\n\nOver time the elves were involved in several wars with the orcs, the dwarves, and the various human kingdoms, as well as various civil wars. Three of the most recent deserve special mention as historically important to current affairs. First, when Dorman I sought to control the entire continent he clashed with the elves on several occasions. These battles are regarded historically as among the only ones he didn't win(they repeatedly stalemated, as he was never able to force the elves to commit to the field, rather they harried his forces until he gave up). Shortly after the death of Dorman I, the Moon Elves, who had taken the brunt of those battles with little support from the west, declared themselves independent of the elven kingdom, calling their new land Demal Thor. War ensued, and the High Elves were unable to retake control of the east. Lastly, there have been repeated conflicts with the dwarves of Curinor over the Mithril Hills, aptly named for their large deposits of easily mined mithril. The most recent war however, resulted in near total victory by the elves. While the resulting peace treaty placed the border almost directly down the middle of the hills, most of the largest mithril deposits are on the elfin side, and the dwarf mines in the area have been abandoned.\n\nEldoran is currently in a state of civil conflict.  The eastern Waelin region has declared itself independent from Eldoran proper, and declared their own king, Saendal Alistiae, once Duke of Estapor.  Meanwhile the recently ascended King Darendel declared every elf in Waelin an outlaw for their treachery. Both sides are still mustering their forces, but all elven forces have been recalled from Gerasalim and Demal Thor as a result of the conflict, and pitched battle is only a matter of time.","gods":["Gaian","Amathera","Sylvan"],"worship":"The elves worship Gaian and Amathera primarily, as nature God and protector.

Aged trees are protected, and most smaller villages are actually built in the canopy of the trees, while the larger cities are built among them and around them. Farmers specifically grow crops that thrive in the shade and the elves tend to live far apart from each other (Eldoran has the one of the lowest population densities of any country.)","economics":"The elves export specialty woods, spices, fine furniture, art, fine steel and mithril.

In fact, just before the invasion Dorman signed onto the alliance and promised his legions. Depending on the historical perspective, either the smaller kingdoms broke the alliance by not reinforcing Dorman's legions, or Dorman did by instead turning his legions against the kingdoms. Whatever the cause, the end result was the total conquest of the entire area by Dorman's ever-victorious legions, who then continued their expansion south into Malinval.\n\nSeveral generations later, with the orcs in a phase of expansion and Dorman V too obsessed with court politics to commit serious resources to guarding the southern border, the people in the south western portion of his empire rose up in mass rebellion. Electing a king from among the local generals, they defeated those garrisons that would not turn, and then threw back the orcish invaders. While in the present day relations with Dormania are friendly, it took several generations and renewed commitments to aid in the defense of the southern borders for that normalization to happen.\n\nToday Gerasalim is in shambles. The Prince of Fiends rise, combined with the internal struggles of Eldoran and Dormania, have left Gerasalim with few allies in its sworn mission to defend the southern border.  After the second fall of Aridhem, the orcs successfully encircled the border forts and have moved into the heartland of Gerasalim, sacking Strovenguard and Eastguard.

It sends the most soldiers to fight, and die, at the border forts with Malinval of any country, and its people see the war as one of both liberation and survival. All young people without children between the ages of 17 and 22 are required to serve in the military according to their talents. Clerics and Wizards must also serve 3 additional years upon completion of their training.","economics":"Gerasalim's economy is primarily agrarian, as they have ample supplies of water, but poor trade connections due to being landlocked. Only Northport has an easy to reach river connection that does not lead through orc-held territories. Nevertheless there are some mines along the southern and eastern edges of the country. Gerasalim exports grain northward and westward out of Northport and into Curinor and Demal Thor.\n\nThe country is subsidized somewhat by the other kingdoms of the alliance, who have armies stationed on Gerasaline soil that require supplies, most easily obtained locally from Gerasalim's merchants.\n\nGerasalim's smiths and craftsman are of average quality, with a few masters practicing in the major cities and working for the armies. It can be hard to find craftsmen experienced with unusual materials.","slavery":"Slavery is illegal in Gerasalim.","magic":"Magical training is encouraged but regulated.

However, naturalization can only be obtained by declaration of the king, usually due to extraordinary service within the military. Noncitizens have limited rights, in that they cannot own land, or graze more than 3 animals on public land, nor vote in elections for King.

When Emperor Dorman I marched through the territory that now makes up Kandor, he found it a hodgepodge of minor kingdoms many of which were practically vassals to the nearby dwarven power in Curinor. In a series of lightning wars he conquered the vassal kingdoms, and managed several key victories against the dwarves, managing to push them back deep into their mountains, and take control of several holds. By the time his empire began to succumb to corruption there was little thought in the dwarven kingdom that those holds could be retaken.

This has sparked rumors that either a particularly adept warlord has united the tribes, or the often-discounted possibility that the Prince of Fiends, a Sorceron long imprisoned in the mountain Dal Okra may have awakened. Nevertheless the local warlords still seem to be more or less in control of their own territory, and the best description of the government currently could probably be described as a despotic confederacy.\n\nRumors in recent months have continued to solidify on the reawakening of the Prince of Fiends.","ruler":"Believed to be the Prince of Fiends","history":"Malinval's size and strength have varied greatly over time depending on the strength of whatever warlords are in power and how fractured their outside enemies are. For example, when the Dormanian and Nerimese Empires were at their heights, Makir and Dal Okra formed the northern border while Makir and Gulutheim formed the eastern, leaving the country at nearly half of its current size. Nevertheless, the last 300 years have seen a slow but steady expansion for the Orcs. Only the imposing Fortress of Light and the difficulty in moving supplies across the Blighted Gap have stopped them from extending their borders possibly as far as Northport and the Moon Pass.\n\nThe orcs are a warlike people, and the land they live in shows the scars of nearly 3000 years of endless wars, including being the location for many major battles in the God's War. The Glass Cliff, the World Crack, and the Rust Desert are three such locations. Meanwhile Black Shard Pass was literally cut out of the mountains by the Dormanian Emperor's magi in order to provide an avenue of attack in his southward expansion, and the Blighted Gap was created when the Orcs burned and salted everything in their path in a major offensive 200 years ago.

The common misconception in the north has always been that the Orcs attack as frenzied berserkers with no thought for strategy, but no thought could be further from the truth. While Orc Berserker's are a fearsome sight, and one worth remembering, they are only one aspect of an orcish fighting force, and not really representative of the culture at large.\n\nIn fact, Malinval encompasses a wide variety of cultures. On the one hand you have the mining city of Parakas, a top down, highly regimented communistic city built entirely of steel (for which it is famous), while on the other you have Forbel, a tent city that has been the site of massive clan wars, as it is the center of the western cattle trade, and up to a dozen warlords have laid claim to it at one time. The capitol, Marinval, is a sprawling city of low sod and brick buildings, temporary fortifications, and castles.","economics":"Malinval is huge, and produces a great many goods for sale and use internally, however, generally the people are poor and overcrowded.  There is little to no trade with it's northern neighbors (that which exists is done entirely in the black market), but it exports a number of goods to Morrindim, Olda, Arad, Terron, and Seran,  particularly food and metal goods.","slavery":"Slavery is common in Malinval, and like in other orc dominated areas most slaves are goblins, with a small smattering of the descendants of Neran refugees and kobolds.","magic":"Magic is allowed, or at least there is no unified statute concerning its use.

Any mage considered a threat to power is usually hunted and executed.","property":"Property is usually what you can hold onto, although there is a certain amount of respect for women and children, and the custom is never to displace from their home a family with kids. This of course encourages breeding so as to avoid losing everything one has to someone stronger than oneself.","citizenship":"Most orcs would sooner die than follow someone not an orc.

The Emperor, known as the Eternal One, lived for nearly 1000 years through the gifts of Nera, his body kept young and powerful. He thought himself immortal, but inevitably Nera's gift began to fade and he began to age. Fearing death, he devised a ritual whereby he could grant himself and all of his people immortality. Indeed it would grant even the beasts of the field and the birds of the air eternal life. He set his people to the task, and when it was ready, he personally cast the spell. When it was over, there was nothing left living for 500 miles around the capital, instead all were transformed into some form of undead, and the emperor a powerful lich. Overcome with rage at his new grotesque form, the emperor led his 'people' on a quest to destroy all life, but the Gods intervened. Building massive mountains around the remains of the empire and blessing those who still lived and fought back with powerful magic to fight undead. It was rumored that the Emperor himself was killed in the push back. The undead armies retreated, but they still remain, and are fought over by necromancers who travel there with the idea of capturing the greatest horde of undead ever seen possibly on any world.\n\nIt was some 200 years before the fall of Nerim that the first orcs emigrated to the Nerimese subcontinent, building small villages in the mostly uninhabited south. At that time the area was mostly wasteland tundra, and the Nerans were uninterested in it or the Orcs. When the fall happened the orcs found themselves just outside of the radius of the Emperor's spell, and soon they were attacked by the undead hordes. They fled to a nearby volcano, where the God Molton sheltered them in deep caves while raining fire on the undead that came against them. They hid in the caves for 10 years before returning to the surface, only to discover that the tundra they had called home was gone, replaced by scorching deserts and ringed with massive mountains. They have since wandered the desert, traveling from oasis to oasis in tribes, building their own traditions and strengths far different from their mainland kin.","gods":["Nera","Molton"],"worship":"The necromancers of the island and the sentient undead still generally practice a perverted form of the worship of Nera.

No animal is killed without being eaten, and even cannibalism has not been unheard of when times were bad.\n\nIn no other place are the ceremonies surrounding disposing of the dead more important. Dead bodies that are not eaten are immolated by each tribes Priest of Molton to avoid the latent magic of the land bringing them back as undead. Something that is all too common in Nerim.

The surviving Nagas were forced into the jungles and swamps, while the giants were wiped out, and the Sorceron killed. These 5 heroes are the ancestors of the modern High Orc nobility, and seeing (in their way) that the natural state of the goblins and kobolds at least was indeed slavery, they set out to be 'benevolent' masters and formed a compact of mutual defense.

This was compounded by the fact that Darendel had recently married a half-elf of questionable birth, meaning future heirs to the throne would not be pure-blooded elves, and by his subsequent mismanagement of the war effort, diverting critical resources to finding and executing a half-dwarf adventurer that had not been seen in months. Rumors likewise began to spread that the new queen had aligned herself with one or more demon lords, and it did not take long for political insiders to see the power she wielded over her husband.\n\nAfter formal protests with the new king about his queen and his use of resources fell on deaf ears, the Waelin dukes, also those hit hardest by the war effort and distant from Loridesa's political control, met in secret to determine a plan. Led by Duchess Sadefa, the Dukes determined that independence was the only viable option, and in concert with the Church of Sylvan, put for a proclomation that the Royal House of Se'la'mer had lost the blessing of Sylvan, and as such no elf was subject to their rule, and until such time as Sylvan chose a new King of the Elves, the Duchies of Waelin would heed no order from Darendel Se'la'mer or any of his representatives.
