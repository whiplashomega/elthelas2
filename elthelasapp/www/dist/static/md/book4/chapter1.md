### Coming Together

<!-- Insert personalized event that brings together the party as allies before given their first mission -->

#### The Council of War

**General Heartbren.** General Heartbren will have observed the bagpipe duel with a certain amusement. He will congratulate Barbarious if he won the duel, and wish him better luck next time if he did not. Then he will invite the party into his offices in the keep. He will take them to a large conference room where his inner council is gathering.

The war council is James Lightbringer, Theodore Gloryheart, Farnor Spiketooth, Haera Oelefros, Wyrmling Trapsmith, and Kyman Hexhammer. The party will arrive before any of the other council members except Ambassador Gloryheart, who General Heartbren will introduce as Theodore Gloryheart, Archduke of Falak, Ambassador of Empress Dormana I. Each of the others will be announced by the Seneschal in this order as such:

*   Duke James Lightbringer, Lord of the East Reach, Lord General of the Rising Dawn, Ambassador of the King of Kandor.
*   Dragon Lord Farnor Spiketooth, Retired Commander of the Western Legion, Special Ambassador of the Dragon Emperor Valraxa
*   Master Bard Haera Oelefros, Chronicler of the Great Histories. Professor Emeritus of History at the Kandori University of Art and Music, Minister of Propoganda for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Wyrmling Trapsmith, Quartermaster for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Kyman Hexhammer, Spymaster for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Malia Demonslayer, High Guardian of Amathera's Shield
*   Vanriel Glamfara, Scout Commander, Master Ranger of Sylvan's Rangers

Gerad will then lay out that each of them has been chosen to serve on a special group designed to bring together a wide range of expertise to deal with particularly thorny problems and missions involved in the war effort. First however, he wants to give them a chance to figure out how to work together as a group before giving them any truly difficult tasks.

<!--Insert Chapter 1 Mission Briefing-->
The influx of refugees here in Cur'Estan has left us with serious resource issues. I have a team attempting to deal with the long term problem of imports, but in the short term we are having trouble with our local sources as well. I would like you to deal with these problems. You can handle them in any order, but all of these are critical problems.

Our first and most important issue is food. A large caravan was supposed to arrive yesterday carrying grain and cooking oil, but we haven't heard from it. Find the caravan, figure out what is holding them up, and make sure they arrive safely.

The second issue we have is with the local Druids. We sent groups into the nearby forests to cut lumber so that we can build homes for the refugees, but they were attacked by groups of wild animals. I suspect the local druidic circle is attempting to prevent the town from expanding. However, these people have nowhere else to go and need homes. I need you to resolve this issue with the druids, one way or another.

The last issue is with a nearby mine. One of our merchants who regularly buys iron from them came back bloodied, and reported that her guards had all been killed by the kobolds who run the place. Find out what is going on out there. We've traded peacefully with those kobolds for years, so for this to happen when we need that iron the most is a big problem.

<!-- Individualized Faction Orders -->

### Faction Orders

**Amathera's Shield**

**Artificer's of Mechanus**

**Black Sun**

**Black Wolf Irregulars**

**Blood Brothers**

**Champions of Cora**

**Dormanian Imperial Guard**

**Guild of Heroes** Word is that there is a dragon in the area and a local merchant has offered a bounty for it's hide. I'm betting it has something to do with that kobold issue. Bring back the dragon's hide to get the bounty.

**International Grangemaster's Alliance** If we are going to feed all these people long term we don't just need houses in town, we need to clear forest for farm land throughout the area. Druids are nice and all, but we are talking about the well being of thousands of people, we cannot have the growth of Cur'Estan be constricted by treaties with Druids.

**Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans** That food caravan was a major investment by the guild, we will provide a bounty for every wagon that makes it here successfully.

**The Inevitables** Hilda Anschütz, a recently arrived refugee, was found dead in her tent this morning and no one is investigating. See Justice Done.

**Keepers of the Grove** The local druids are only doing their best to protect their land, make sure this issue is resolved without further bloodshed.

**Lords of the Rising Dawn** These attacks against the people of Cur'Estan must not go unpunished. Punitive measures must be taken against both the Druids and Kobolds, take them into custody if possible, kill them if you must.

**Makers of Legend**

**Masters of the Deep Song** There are dwarves among the refugees who would be glad to take over that iron mine and trade with the community, meanwhile these kobolds are guilty of murder. Drive them out of the mine and I will send good dwarven miners to take it over.

**Shepherds of the All-Mother** Lucretia the merchant has asked that the bodies of her guards be recovered. Recover the bodies from the kobolds and bring them back so that we can give them their funeral rites.

**Silver Dragon Knights** I suspect a chromatic dragon may be behind the kobolds sudden change of heart, if this is the case hunt down and kill that dragon.

**Sylvan's Rangers** Two of our scouts went out to guide that caravan into town yesterday, make sure they come back alive. -Vanriel Glamfara

**Trollkin Mercenary Corps**

**Union of Wizard's Colleges** I believe the druids have a cache of tomes of magical knowledge. Please retreive them for our new college.
<!-- Mission Part 1 -->

## The Kobold Mine

Gerad can point the party in the direction of the merchant, Lucretia Dorotheus.

#### The Cave Entrance

The cave entrance stands blocked by wooden blockades. A few kobolds in rough armor with crossbows and spears stand on stools behind the blockades. As soon as they see the players, one of them will burst run into the mines top speed, taking the first kobold tunnel. The rest of them won’t stand and fight either. After giving a brief warning to the players to leave from a distance, they will fire off a volley.  If the players continue approaching they will jump down. The last to leave will throw a torch on the deliberately oil soaked blockade, lighting it on fire. Meanwhile other kobolds will appear from kobold paths higher up the hill, poking their heads out and firing down on the players, before darting back into their tunnels. The upper tunnels are easily discoverable, but impassable by medium characters. Behind the barricade is a depression in the ground with a tiny hole leading to a pipe system. Once the players are past the barricade, it begins filling with acid.

#### Tunnels Part 1

The tunnels beyond consist of a single 10-foot wide, winding corridor, with railroad tracks. 20 ft in there is a kobold tunnel that goes to the left, and a mining cart filled with iron ore that nearly fills the passage. A medium character must squeeze on either side to get past the cart. Beyond the cart trip wires cross the corridor every 10-15 feet for the next 100 feet as the corridor winds around the corner and down a steep hill. By the second trip wire a crushed human corpse is visible from next to the cart. The body has been looted, but an intelligence check can identify it as one of the wagoneers who had previously been sent to retrieve ore from the mine. The trip wires do the following (in order):

1.	Razor wire. This firmly attached razor thin wire will cut at the ankles of anyone who doesn’t step carefully over it.
2.	Nothing, just trips the player.
3.	Causes a spider web to fall from the ceiling.
4.	Has been imbued with a faerie fire spell.
5.	Causes acid to spill from the ceiling above where the mining cart was, that then streams down the hill.
6.	Has been imbued with a grease spell that covers the floor of the hallway.
7.	 More Razor wire.
8.	Opens a pit trap beneath it. The cart will eventually fall into this, carrying any players it is dragging with it.

Once the third tripwire has been passed and the players are around the corner, they will hear a creaking sound as the mining cart gets pushed down after them. A side passage after the 4th trip wire goes up steeply to a dead end, but the wall at the end of that tunnel is an illusion behind which the kobolds have rigged a flamethrower that fills the tunnel. If players step into this passage to avoid the cart the kobolds will fill it with fire. 3 Kobolds with crossbows will open a trap door in the ceiling above the 6th trip wire once the players are underneath. They will drop a torch (lighting the grease if it was triggered) and fire a crossbow volley before closing their trap door again. If anyone falls into the pit trap, kobolds will rush in from their connecting kobold tunnels and try to stab them to death with spears.

#### Tunnels Part 2

Just beyond the pit trap another set of barricades has been set up, these ones made of piled up rocks. Players who come into sight will be pelted with bolts. If the players come within 30 ft, the kobolds on the barricade will retreat into their side tunnels just behind, except for one, who will commit suicide by bomb, lighting a barrel of gunpowder concealed behind the barricade on fire. The kobolds have additional arrow slits accessible from their small tunnels that open into the area behind the barricade from which they will try to continue to pelt the players with bolts. At the far end of the hallway, they have set up a ballista. The first player who crosses the barricade will be able to see it, with a kobold ready to flip the switch and send a giant bolt at him.

#### Tunnels Part 3

The tunnel veers sharply to the right after the ballista, beyond which there is a series of pit traps. The kobolds have made the first 10-foot pit trap obvious. However, the ground beyond that trap has been undermined so that anything heavier than a kobold who lands on it will cause the ground to collapse. If the players fall into the pit kobolds will run out from their tunnels at the far end to rain arrows on them. A third pit trap just beyond that one is filled with a gelatinous cube.

#### Tunnels Part 4



#### The Dragon’s Lair

The black dragon sleeps in a pool of acid in a large chamber. He is attended by a kobold sorcerer and a half-dozen servants/guards and any other kobolds who escaped from further up the tunnels. His small but significant horde sits in the corner of the room. The kobolds will attack the players ferociously here, no longer running but now fighting to the death. The dragon will jump in at the top of the second round of combat. Above the fight a cavernous vertical passage leads up and out to the sky, a network of massive spider webs blocking the path. If the fight is going poorly, the Dragon may breath up into this passage, melting the webs and sending the giant spiders down on the party. The spiders attack kobolds and party members alike indiscriminately, avoiding attacking only the dragon, who they fear instinctually.
