## Kobold Cave

#### The Cave Entrance

The cave entrance stands blocked by wooden blockades. A few kobolds in rough armor with crossbows and spears stand on stools behind the blockades. As soon as they see the players, one of them will burst run into the mines top speed, taking the first kobold tunnel. The rest of them won’t stand and fight either. After giving a brief warning to the players to leave from a distance, they will fire off a volley.  If the players continue approaching they will jump down. The last to leave will throw a torch on the deliberately oil soaked blockade, lighting it on fire. Meanwhile other kobolds will appear from kobold paths higher up the hill, poking their heads out and firing down on the players, before darting back into their tunnels. The upper tunnels are easily discoverable, but impassable by medium characters. Behind the barricade is a depression in the ground with a tiny hole leading to a pipe system. Once the players are past the barricade, it begins filling with acid.

#### Tunnels Part 1

The tunnels beyond consist of a single 10-foot wide, winding corridor, with railroad tracks. 20 ft in there is a kobold tunnel that goes to the left, and a mining cart filled with iron ore that nearly fills the passage. A medium character must squeeze on either side to get past the cart. Beyond the cart trip wires cross the corridor every 10-15 feet for the next 100 feet as the corridor winds around the corner and down a steep hill. By the second trip wire a crushed human corpse is visible from next to the cart. The body has been looted, but an intelligence check can identify it as one of the wagoneers who had previously been sent to retrieve ore from the mine. The trip wires do the following (in order):

1.	Razor wire. This firmly attached razor thin wire will cut at the ankles of anyone who doesn’t step carefully over it.
2.	Nothing, just trips the player.
3.	Causes a spider web to fall from the ceiling.
4.	Has been imbued with a faerie fire spell.
5.	Causes acid to spill from the ceiling above where the mining cart was, that then streams down the hill.
6.	Has been imbued with a grease spell that covers the floor of the hallway.
7.	 More Razor wire.
8.	Opens a pit trap beneath it. The cart will eventually fall into this, carrying any players it is dragging with it.

Once the third tripwire has been passed and the players are around the corner, they will hear a creaking sound as the mining cart gets pushed down after them. A side passage after the 4th trip wire goes up steeply to a dead end, but the wall at the end of that tunnel is an illusion behind which the kobolds have rigged a flamethrower that fills the tunnel. If players step into this passage to avoid the cart the kobolds will fill it with fire. 3 Kobolds with crossbows will open a trap door in the ceiling above the 6th trip wire once the players are underneath. They will drop a torch (lighting the grease if it was triggered) and fire a crossbow volley before closing their trap door again. If anyone falls into the pit trap, kobolds will rush in from their connecting kobold tunnels and try to stab them to death with spears.

#### Tunnels Part 2

Just beyond the pit trap another set of barricades has been set up, these ones made of piled up rocks. Players who come into sight will be pelted with bolts. If the players come within 30 ft, the kobolds on the barricade will retreat into their side tunnels just behind, except for one, who will commit suicide by bomb, lighting a barrel of gunpowder concealed behind the barricade on fire. The kobolds have additional arrow slits accessible from their small tunnels that open into the area behind the barricade from which they will try to continue to pelt the players with bolts. At the far end of the hallway, they have set up a ballista. The first player who crosses the barricade will be able to see it, with a kobold ready to flip the switch and send a giant bolt at him.

#### Tunnels Part 3

The tunnel veers sharply to the right after the ballista, beyond which there is a series of pit traps. The kobolds have made the first 10-foot pit trap obvious. However, the ground beyond that trap has been undermined so that anything heavier than a kobold who lands on it will cause the ground to collapse. If the players fall into the pit kobolds will run out from their tunnels at the far end to rain arrows on them. A third pit trap just beyond that one is filled with a gelatinous cube.

#### Tunnels Part 4



#### The Dragon’s Lair

The black dragon sleeps in a pool of acid in a large chamber. He is attended by a kobold sorcerer and a half-dozen servants/guards and any other kobolds who escaped from further up the tunnels. His small but significant horde sits in the corner of the room. The kobolds will attack the players ferociously here, no longer running but now fighting to the death. The dragon will jump in at the top of the second round of combat. Above the fight a cavernous vertical passage leads up and out to the sky, a network of massive spider webs blocking the path. If the fight is going poorly, the Dragon may breath up into this passage, melting the webs and sending the giant spiders down on the party. The spiders attack kobolds and party members alike indiscriminately, avoiding attacking only the dragon, who they fear instinctually.
