#### The Council of War

**General Heartbren.** General Heartbren will have observed the bagpipe duel with a certain amusement. He will congratulate Barbarious if he won the duel, and wish him better luck next time if he did not. Then he will invite the party into his offices in the keep. He will take them to a large conference room where his inner council is gathering.

The war council is James Lightbringer, Theodore Gloryheart, Farnor Spiketooth, Haera Oelefros, Wyrmling Trapsmith, and Kyman Hexhammer. The party will arrive before any of the other council members except Ambassador Gloryheart, who General Heartbren will introduce as Theodore Gloryheart, Archduke of Falak, Ambassador of Empress Dormana I. Each of the others will be announced by the Seneschal in this order as such:

*   Duke James Lightbringer, Lord of the East Reach, Lord General of the Rising Dawn, Ambassador of the King of Kandor.
*   Dragon Lord Farnor Spiketooth, Retired Commander of the Western Legion, Special Ambassador of the Dragon Emperor Valraxa
*   Master Bard Haera Oelefros, Chronicler of the Great Histories. Professor Emeritus of History at the Kandori University of Art and Music, Minister of Propoganda for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Wyrmling Trapsmith, Quartermaster for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Kyman Hexhammer, Spymaster for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Malia Demonslayer, High Guardian of Amathera's Shield
*   Vanriel Glamfara, Scout Commander, Master Ranger of Sylvan's Rangers

Gerad will then lay out that each of them has been chosen to serve on a special group designed to bring together a wide range of expertise to deal with particularly thorny problems and missions involved in the war effort. First however, he wants to give them a chance to figure out how to work together as a group before giving them any truly difficult tasks.
