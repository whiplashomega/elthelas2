# Chapter 2: Sealed

## Preparation


### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders

The refugees from Northport managed to smuggle out artifacts that we must guarantee will not fall into the hands of the enemy. I know of a hidden dungeon where I would like to seal these artifacts in northern Kandor. Travel to Mount Frost and find the lair of the Ancient Silver Dragon Bimriel. Get the Dragon to agree to guard the artifacts as a part of its horde.

#### Black Wolf Irregulars Orders

I need you to make a surreptitious pickup in the nearby town. The local blacksmith is one of our covert agent, and will have a packet of intelligence reports we need you to retreive and bring back. Do not let anyone else see them, not even allies.

#### Inevitables Orders

The Time Egg is a particularly noxious artifact, though the General and his fellows do not know it's full nature, it breaks the laws of time and must be destroyed. The Egg can be destroyed by subjecting it to extreme heat, but be cautious, it is a fragment of the will of Amathera, and her agents may attempt to stop you. -Quarut, Inevitable of Time

#### Sylvan's Rangers Orders

The Dragon uses some unusual creatures not seen elsewhere on the continent to defend his lair, we'd like you to capture one of these giant hairy creatures and bring it back to study.

#### Union of Wizard's College Orders

Bimriel, it is rumored, has recorded eons of history on the walls of her home. Please transcribe as much of this as you can.

### The Artifacts

The Artifacts have been locked in a warded chest that acts similarly to a bag of holding (technically holding the artifacts in a demi-plane). The warding on the chest is specially designed to prevent their influence from seeping into the material plane and to prevent them from being found by magical means. However, General Heartbren trusts the key to the chest to the party.

<!-- Time Egg -->
<aside>
  <h4>The Time Egg (wondrous item, legendary)</h4>
  <p>
    The Time Egg is a powerful artifact of Amathera, when the egg is held and the proper command word spoken, the user is brought back in time to wherever they were 24 hours 
    before, their memory intact of all that transpired during the previous iteration of that time. They then are able to relive that day, changing what they do, potentially
    undoing a catastrophic mistake, or intervening in an event that they previously had no way to foresee. Unfortunately the egg also has a horrible side effect preventing
    frivolous use.  After the 24 hours has elapsed, the mind of the user collapses on itself and they die instantly.
  </p>
</aside>
<!-- Barrier Crystal -->
<aside>
  <h4>The Barrier Crystal (wondrous item, legendary, attunement)</h4>
  <p>
    This crystal is a fragment of the Arcanum crystal that separates the material plane from the remainder of the multiverse, and is the combination of two barrier crystals.
    This crystal now serves the function of both of the two smaller crystals, and manipulating it connects one both to the abyss, and to the mysterious plane of the creature
    known as 'ME'. As soon as you touch the crystal, the entities beyond it become aware of you. The demons immediately use it to steal some of your lifeforce to open the
    briefest of portals to the material plane, causing a random demon to appear within 30 ft of you. This demon obeys your commands, so long as those commands serve the
    greater goals of its demonic lord, such as causing chaos, destruction, and murder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, when you touch the crystal the creature 'ME' attempts to take control of your mind. Make a DC 20 Charisma save. If you fail, you lose control of yourself, as
    if under the affects of dominate monster, however you do not get additional saves. If the remove curse or greater restoration spell is cast on you, you can attempt the
    save again. While under the affects of the crystal, you work tirelessly to serve the inscrutable interests of 'ME'.

<!-- Book of Vile Darkness -->
<aside>
  <h4>The Book of Vile Darkness</h4>
  <p>
    Anyone that attempts to read this book by proxy, such as scrying, using a familiar, using a mind controlled person, or any similar magic, will find the words to slip 
    away from their sight and be illegible. If a person willfully focuses and attempts to read the book, they must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw. On a success, they 
    realize the book is trying to influence their mind, but can still willfully read the book. On a failure, the person gains the flaw of “This book is the solution to 
    all my problems, to answer to my prayers, and I was destined to have it.”. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you finish reading the book, you become attuned to it. Once attuned, your alignment becomes evil, and must remain so to keep the knowledge and benefits of the 
    book. A person attuned to the book may not actively participate in an act of good, and must commit an evil act at least once every 10 days, or the book shall work to 
    find a worthier host.
  </p>
  <p>
    The book of vile darkness cannot be destroyed by any normal means. A good angelic being or deity which destroys the book causes the book to 
    disappear for 1d100 years, before the book reforms. If the book is lost and un-attuned it will subtly manipulate events to better increase the chances of it being 
    found. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The very presence of the book seems to seep evil into the surrounding area. The book causes plants to wither and die if near the book for more than 1 day.
  </p>
  <p>
    While attuned you gain the following benefits:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You increase either your intelligence or charisma by 4, to a max of 24.</li>
    <li>Your Wisdom decreases by 2, to a min of 6.</li>
    <li>A burn mark appears on the back of your left hand, marking you as the owner of the book. The mark is of Azreal, the angel of death, in the shape of a slice 
      cutting through a formless soul. You can reveal this mark to another intelligent evil creature to gain advantage on persuasion, deception or intimidation checks
      against them, as all evil creatures understand the marks importance, even if they do not understand its meaning.</li>
    <li>You lose any connection to any neutral or good divine/powerful beings. You must re-spec any levels of cleric or paladin to another available class, or take the 
      oath-breaker paladin class track.</li>
    <li>You can cast the following spells once a day each without material components and without expending a spell slot: Animate dead (at the 5th level), 
      Create undead, speak with dead, dance macabre, feign death, and harm. You use either Charisma or Intelligence as your casting modifier for these spells.</li>
    <li>You add the following spells to your list of known and prepared spells. The spells do not count against your number of prepared spells, and the spells are 
      forgotten if you unattuned from the book.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Toll of the Damned</strong> cantrip necromancy (V, S) Casting time: 1 action Duration: instant<br />
    You point at a creature that you can see and has the ability to hear sounds. The creature begins to hear a chorus of dolorous bells which fill the air around it for a 
    moment and beckon the creature to the afterlife. Constructs are immune. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is 
    missing more than half of its hitpoints, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage. The spells damage increases by one die when you reach 5 th level (2d8 or 2d12), 
    11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).
  </p>
  <p>
    Darkbolt 2nd level necromancy (V, S) Casting time: 1 action Duration: instant<br />
    This spell sends a surge of pure negative energy towards a target. Undead and constructs are immune. Make a spell attack roll against a target within 60ft that you
    can see. On hit, the target takes 5d6 necrotic damage and must make a constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.<br />
    At higher levels: The damage increases by 1d6 for every level above 2 nd that you cast this spell.
  </p>
  <p>
    You also learn to summon more powerful undead by channeling energy from the negative elemental plane directly.

    dwarves. It seeks to destroy all who are not dwarves, especially orc and goblinoids, and wants to protect dwarves at all cost. Whelm forms a psychic connect with it
    wielder; if its wielder acts in way contrary to Whelm desires, Whelm may refuse to grant the wielder its abilities, or Whelm may attempt to take control of its 
    wielder for a short time. The Save DC to resist Whelm is 16.
