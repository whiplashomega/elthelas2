# Chapter Progression

## Chapter 1 - Recruits

This chapter is an introductory chapter to bring the party together, present some starting challenges, and introduce the episodic format of the campaign and the way factions work in this campaign.

## Chapter 2 - Sealed

This chapter is intended to be a 'proving' for the characters before they embark on serious world changing challenges.

## Chapter 3 - United Front

This chapter introduces Warlord Cratus, and presents the players with the situation at the war front. This is the last chapter in a set order. From here they get 4 options from the General, as well as having the ability to choose their own strategy.

* Chapter 4 - Behind Enemy Lines
* Chapter 5 - Civil War
* Chapter 6 - Halls of the Underking
* Chapter 7 - Waelin Independence

**Behind Enemy Lines** - General Heartbren feels the army could use help delaying the orc army to help them organize the army they have assembled.

**Civil War** - Moving against Manius Aquila would start with flipping Cur'Mestin, once Manius Aquila is dealt with Dormania will be able to join the war with their full force

**Halls of the Underking** - The dwarven withdrawal from the war has been catastrophic to the alliance, convincing them to come back would provide much needed reinforcements

**Waelin Independence** - The elves are fighting each other instead of helping the war effort, but our diplomats report that the new king of Waelin would much rather be fighting with us than fighting his kin, forging a truce in the west would force a second front on the orcs.

## Chapter 4 - Behind Enemy Lines

This chapter involves fomenting rebellion against the orcs in Strovenguard, to force Warlord Cratus's attention back to the south. Completing this chapter puts the orcs on high alert, setting up Chapter 8 - Defense of Cur'Estan to happen after any one other chapter is completed.

## Chapter 9 - Parakas Steel

The behavior of the orcs in Cur'Estan and Curin Keep makes us believe the loyalty of the orcs to the Prince of Fiends is less than absolute. The orcs from Parakas never participated in the fighting in either location, go to Parakas, and figure out a way to meet with the Warlord in secret. If we can flip him, we can get valuable intelligence that may lead us to a way to kill the Prince himself.
