#### Backstory

Father was the Air Genie, Stratos, and her mother was Tia Woodthrall, second wife to the noble elf Phanthos Woodthrall, of Loridesa, Eldoran. Phanthos’s first wife died in childbirth to his second son. He married Tia who gave birth to twin sons. While on holiday in Dera Dragorim, Tia was seduced by Stratos. Months later, she gave birth to Eyvindra Veil. Though Phanthos hated Eyvindra, her mother loved her dearly. As did her two half brothers, Svarlt and Alfie. But her step brothers, Krose and Everette, hated her as much as their father.

Her skin is a breathtaking Iris Blue, while her eyes are the color of perfectly polished sapphires. Her near-knee length, wispy hair is such a light shade of blue, it almost looks like the silver shine of the full moon. She is small, for a half-elf/genasi, standing only five feet tall. She is the personification of wind, with a chaotic elegance that sometimes seems unsteady. Her voice makes the heavens jealous. Soothing, silvery and honeyed, her voice is ultimately alluring, but the faint echo tends to remind others that Eyvindra was conceived by an other-planar being, which can sometimes be unsettling. 

Eyvindra’s otherworldly appearance was one of the many reasons her step father and his council decided it was for the greater good of the city that she be exiled. Her step father and the rest of the city noble elves claimed she had been sending the cities girls and young women into the woods to be sacrificed to the gods and other-planar beings. They claimed she was sent as a spy and usurper by the Genie, sent to corrupt and manipulate the fair and just Elves of the land.  At 13, Eyvindra’s step brothers packed her belongings and some supplies, put her in a carriage and took her far up into the mountains north of Dima. There, she found a small, two room cottage, a small barn with a goat, a sheep, a pony and a couple chickens, a stream nearby and a small plot of land to farm. Her step brother’s explained that she was seen as a threat to their city, society and culture, and was therefore sent to this miserable spot of land to live out the rest of her days. This was their mercy. If she left the seclusion of the mountain for longer than 36 hours, the time it would theoretically take her to climb down the mountain, arrive at the Dima market, buy supplies and return back to her cottage, she would be brought back to Loridesa and executed. She spent 5 years in exile. Then left the island all together as a stow away on a ship leaving to one of the mainlands. 

At 18, she traveled to Port Smith where she spend 11 months as a beggar and vagabond, meeting all manner of beings and learning many new skills and discovering her natural talents. Among those she met are:

* A Water Genasi named Xandur Waves who introduced her to a librarian at one of the main archives. Librarian’s name was Mayweather Flare, she was also an Air Genasi (her mother was an Air Genasi). Mayweather spent her down time at the archives teaching Eyvindra about the Genie, the various Elemental Planes, and about being an Air Genasi.
* A Human Ranger names Carver Edlund, a world-wide renowned explorer within the Sylvan’s Rangers organization. At first, he merely wished to help her learn that wandering, traveling and exploring the world was not the curse she saw it as but a blessing of life and gives the same freedoms as the Air from which she pulls her heritage. As he taught her how to hone her skills as a traveler and explorer, he developed a deep emotional bond to her. Unfortunately, the Voice in Eyvindra’s head convinced her he was going to use her and leave her, like everyone else, so she left him without saying goodbye.
* A Half-elf male named Bard, the Bard of Whispers, a scholar from the not-so prestigious Bardic College of Whispers. He came across her while she was living in the archives of the town and begging for food on the streets. He saw great potential in her anger and emotional despair, and began teaching her how to use the art of deception and manipulation to extort information, as well as the talent needed to turn that information around and use it for her benefit.

At 19 she returned to her home, in the disguise of an Moon Elf emissary from Demal Thor. As she infiltrated the various statuses within the Noble Council, she learned that the Council members were actually to blame for the disappearances of the girls and young female elves. The very disappearances of which she had been accused and for what she had subsequently been exiled. She also found out that her step father, Phanthos had set her mother up to be seduced by Stratos. Phanthos owed a debt to the Planar Being and paid through his second wife. The Elf Noble did not, however, expect his wife to fall pregnant and bear the Being’s child. As soon as suspicions started rousing about the disappearances, Phanthos saw an opportunity to be rid of the offspring he abhorred. When Tia Woodthrall, Eyvindra’s mother, learned of what happened to her daughter, she became so distraught that she had let it happen, she threw herself off the cliffs, into the sea. Her sons, Svarlt and Alfie, went searching for Eyvindra, and were never heard from again.  (you can decide why the Council members were luring away the girls and women, what they were doing. Killing them as a sacrifice, selling them, whatever could work for storytelling).

Eyvindra used the information she gained to obtain her freedom from the Council’s exile and execution sentencing. (she was marked for death when it was discovered she’d left her cottage in the mountains). Before leaving the island of Eldoran, she was told by one of her brother’s best friends that they had both been seen in Cur’Estan, traveling with a Human Ranger who had claimed to also be seeking Eyvindra Veil. 

She left Eldoran days after her reveal to Phanthos, traveling the realm, looking for her place within it. She met many people, used her knowledge she gained from Bard the Bard of Whispers, and gained recognition as an aspiring bard. Rarely, does she use the underhanded acts of the College of Whispers, as they were taught to her, but sometimes, they come in handy when caught in a tight spot. 

A month ago she arrived in Cur’Estan. Mostly, she keeps to herself on the outskirts of town, until she needs supplies, or she gets lonely. Her years as a hermit in exile in the mountains have taken their toll, she was so young, after all. And every once in a while, the Voice in her head reminds her of her needs. Sometimes it’s food or drink. Sometimes it’s company. Sometimes it’s the thrill of something new. And she knows from experience, it’s unwise not to do as the Voice suggests. It did plan out the fall of her step father, after all. 

Instead of seeking them out right away, the Voice in her head convinced Eyvindra she didn’t need anyone, so she decided to travel, explore and learn throughout the realm. Only a month ago, did she arrive in Cur’Estan, having gotten letters from her brothers, and another one from Carver Edlund. Her brothers letters were cryptic and worrisome. Carver’s requested her presence, asking her to find him at the Sylvan’s Ranger outpost within Cur’Estan. Though his letter was also cryptic, mentioning his acquaintance and explorations with her brothers, it was also demanding and aggressive. (you can decide what the letters said, why Carver is seeking her out and has asked her to the city, where her brothers are, etc).

Curious, Eyvindra finds herself in a strange and hectic city, searching for her brothers and a man she once thought had fallen in love with her, but is now suspicious wants something else.

#### Backstory
"Otherworldly." She's exceptionally tall and thin, and wears fully-covering monk's robes and a hood at all times. She also wears a perfectly smooth white mask, with only two holes cut for her eyes. Speaking of eyes, they're alien too: they stare intensely without blinking, and change color with her emotions. She doesn't really "pass" for any known race, and only the most knowledgeable people figure out "what" she is without asking.

She's very graceful, and travels light--she doesn't seem to care much about worldly possessions. She also doesn't talk much, and generally makes people very uneasy with the mask, and the silence, and the staring, and the alien body proportions... and she gives off a fair whirring sound??

**Her story so far:**

Her parents were Hisru craftsmen and inventors in Zelfir; their lives were prosperous but they were unable to have children. One day, a Stagen gnome came to their workshop, having heard of their inventions. He stayed with them for a month to exchange knowledge. He suggested they pray to Tock--the Creator God would surely have no problem giving them a child.

This sounded blasphemous to the monotheistic Zelfirans, but they tried it anyhow. To their joy, they had a child within the year. They named her Ēnyì, meaning a gift from God and a debt of gratitude.

She didn't quite look like either of her parents, or any of the people in her city--she had olive skin and black hair like most Hisru, but she was almost unnaturally tall and slender. She also didn't fit in well with local culture: she cared little for custom, religion, or making friends, and instead was consumed by reading and making small toys in her parents' workshop. They didn't mind.

When Ēnyì was eight years old, two robed figures appeared at the workshop. They told her parents that she is the Yīnguǒ Bàoyìng--the "Retribution of Fate." According to the strange monks, their order had predicted her birth, and she was a divinely-touched being sent by Tock to right a great wrong that had not even happened yet.

This didn't make any sense to Ēnyì's parents. Even worse, the monks said Ēnyì needed to come live in their monastery to study the "Immutable Order of the Universe" and prepare for her "piece of the Divine Plan" to "uphold the Eternal Laws." Her parents were inconsolable, and tried to tell the monks to leave their home.

While the monks were talking to her parents, Ēnyì had quietly gone to her room and packed a bag. When she returned, she simply said, "I'm ready to go now." She promised her parents to return when she was done training, and said goodbye.

--

The monastery was nestled in a very remote mountain range, somewhere in the mountains of Atyrea. It was an imposing building, hewn of cold stone and kept dark. The monks did not need light, as Tock had given them the power to see in the dark.

The monastery was the headquarters of a secretive order: The Inevitables. Fashioned after Tock's Inevitables (constructs from Mechanus that uphold the five Eternal Laws), the order is a group of assassins and operatives that serve the Laws in the mortal realm. They study a unique and highly secret martial technique that makes them nigh-unstoppable. They are not affiliated with Tock's church, and don't worship him so much as serve pure order itself, though Tock is their godly benefactor.

She gave up the name Ēnyì, and became Kismet. There were other trainees there, of all sorts of races, but they were all adults: normally one has to already be a very accomplished warrior or assassin before being invited to join The Inevitables. Kismet learned that she was something called an Aasimar, and specifically one from Tock, which is incredibly rare. The monastery wasn't exactly intended to be a place for a child to grow up, and instead of a family she only had a rotating cast of killers and spies who came for their training.

Kismet didn't mind losing her childhood, because she was so deeply fulfilled with learning and having such a clear, well-defined purpose and point to everything she did. Everyone praised her and assured her she would accomplish her great task. No one could say what it was, though--that time would come.

--

Kismet trained as long as she could. She joined other members on their missions, building real-world experience hunting down Law-breakers. A year ago the masters decided she had learned as much as she could, and she should set out alone. By then it had been 28 years since she left her parents. (Kismet, like most Aasimar, ages about twice as slowly as a human.)

When she visited her parents like she promised, they immediately recognized her otherworldly stature and grace, but they did not recognize the person she had become. Kismet said farewell to her elderly parents for the last time, and boarded a ship for Elathia.

**Where are they from?**

Zelfir until she was 8, then The Inevitables' monastery until she was 37.

**They are starting the campaign at level 3... What have they done in the past?**

Kismet was training with The Inevitables to be the Yīnguǒ Bàoyìng--the "Retribution of Fate."

**Where were they before the start of the campaign?**

She was instructed to go to Cur'Estan; she just arrived after traveling.

**Do they have family or friends somewhere that they care about? Who are their parents? How has their family affected their life?**

Her parents are alive, but not in her life (and haven't been for decades). The closest thing she has to a social community is the order, but she doesn't have real friends or loved ones. 

I'm going for Dalai Lama vibes here--what happens when you take a small child from their family, tell them their a chosen one, put them on a pedestal, and don't let anyone get close to them? Maybe she'll learn the True Meaning of Friendship in the campaign. :)

**If you are a member of a faction, how did you join it, what is your standing in that organization?**

Kismet's a sort of prophesied chosen one, but she's also still really new and hasn't proven herself yet. The order knows better than to put her in over her head right away, but have big plans for her. She has no say in any of this, which doesn't bother her because she is insanely Lawful and likes having clear-cut purpose.

**Is your character heroic? Would they lay down their life or otherwise make sacrifices for the greater good or to save another?**

If "greater good" = Eternal Laws, without pause. If not, then nope. She has to stay focused.

**What are their immediate goals? Are you seeking wealth, fame, glory? Are you after something more specific? Why?**

She receives instructions telepathically from The Inevitables, and does those. She doesn't really understand autonomy (yet), and doesn't really have personal goals.

**Is your character religious? If so who? (and of course, why?)**

She was born through Tock's will, is a divinely-graced being of Tock, and serves him and the Eternal Laws through The Inevitables. But she does not really participate in organized religion or worship; it's more like a philosophy and way of life for her.

**Is your character merciful? Unforgiving? Temperate? Regularly Drunk? Scholarly? What character traits do they have that shape how they approach problems?**

Kismet genuinely believes she is an unstoppable force, and any setback is fate and happens for a good reason. Success is to her, pre-determined.
The Inevitables swear to never harm those who have not committed a crime, and also that no one, not even a divine being, is above the law. So she's merciful in the sense that she will not harm innocents, but it's not out of sympathy so much as lawfulness.
She doesn't handle moral ambiguity well, and always seeks the right answer to every question. Therefore most problems can be solved by thinking them through rationally, and if they can't, it must mean she doesn't have enough information yet. "No right answer" does not compute.

#### Backstory

Varius is a young kobold with bright gold scales, and is the sixth son of Queen Eliana III. He’s cheerful to a fault, follows orders without question, and is determined to prove his people are just as capable of heroism as the less “monstrous” races. He was sent by the Queen to enlist with the Black Wolf Irregulars to better represent his people in the war against the Orcs. Kobolds aren't always warmly welcomed or trusted, and he's been sent in civilian gear to avoid accusations of spying or thievery.

His clan is long-descended from a gold dragon; the current royal line bear a striking resemblance to their draconic ancestor. They originally hailed from the Sword Mountains in Dormania, and considered themselves Imperial subjects. Kobold craftsmen and miners are very skilled, but a combination of racism and competition with Curinor kept them from finding a place in human society, and they languished in isolation. In 1815, Queen Clara Eliana III came to power and immediately set about changing that. The Fortress of Light represented a great opportunity: the Alliance armies needed supplies, Geraslim would rather produce them locally than rely on Curinor, and Strovenguard’s universities were full of knowledge the kobolds needed to prosper. The clan made the dangerous trek overland, purchased several long-abandoned mines to the west of Strovenguard, and set to work.

Varius was born in 1838, and only five years later the Crystal was stolen from the Fortress of Light. The kobolds evacuated their civilians to the north, and constructed a network of hidden trap-filled tunnels near major cities.  As the orcs advanced, the kobolds harried them and deprived them of plunder and materiel. When Varius was old enough, he volunteered to serve as a military scout. Given his lineage, he was assigned to work under Commander Ludo, a brash but skilled kobold ranger who served with the Black Wolf Irregulars before age and injuries forced his retirement. Ludo liked Varius because he kept a cool head, and went to great lengths to ensure his squadmates made it back alive. Ludo taught Varius what he could about fieldcraft and the smatterings of magic he’d picked up.

His squad picked through blood-stained battlefields or evacuated settlements, looking for survivors and refugees and bringing back anything of value. Varius saw more than his share of tunnel-fighting against the goblins who were sent in to clear them, but they avoided protracted fighting with orcs at all costs. One fateful day, Varius’s squad came upon a surreal sight: a traveling circus had attracted the attention of roving Orcish soldiers, and abandoned their wagons in a desperate attempt to reach safety. Most of the trinkets were useless, but Varius stumbled upon a set of unnervingly life-like figurines hidden in one of the wagons, which he pocketed. Before leaving, Varius set the animals free, figuring they had a better chance of surviving in the wild than they did if the orcs returned.

On the way back to camp, the kobolds stumbled onto a large column of orcs which was making directly for Strovenguard, and were spotted. The squad scattered, but a poisoned arrow caught Varius’s side, and he collapsed. Suddenly, one of the animals Varius had rescued - a massive gorilla - dropped out of one of the nearby trees, grabbed him, and sprinted into the trees. When Varius came to, he healed himself enough to travel and set off at a run to raise the alarm. The gorilla followed Varius all the way back, and Commander Ludo taught Varius the ritual needed to form a bond with him. Varius named the ape Silvester, and they’ve been inseparable ever since.

**Where are they from?**

Varius grew up in the hills west of Strovengard, raised by kobolds who immigrated relatively recently from the Sword Mountains.
They are starting the campaign at level 3, which means they have some history and skill already. What have they done in the past?
See above; primarily, scouting and fighting in guerilla warfare (pun intended) against the Orcs.

**Where were they before the start of the campaign?**

In Strovengard prior to its fall; moved north with his people into Kandor after that. I imagine his people live somewhere in the foothills west/northwest of Purs, depending on local geography.

**Do they have family or friends somewhere that they care about? Who are their parents? How has their family affected their life?**

His mother’s the Queen of his (relatively small) clan of kobolds, and he’s here on her orders. He didn’t really receive special treatment in most of his life because he’s the youngest child and far from the throne, but people had high expectations for him and his time in the military has definitely put him in the spotlight. Varius is the youngest child, and I don’t imagine him as particularly close to his siblings, who are likely more highly educated and a lot less likely to see combat (craftsmen, maybe actually managed to study in Strovengard?). 
He’s very close to his (now former) commander, Ludo.  He had plenty of friends in the military, and likely still does, though I imagine that it’s been a relatively bloody fight even for skirmishers.

**If you are a member of a faction, how did you join it, what is your standing in that organization?**

Black Wolf Irregulars made the most sense as a faction, in which case he’s going to enlist (could have already enlisted recently if it’s helpful for the plot!). He has a reference of his former commander who trained him well.

He’s at least initially directly working for his clan. They likely aren’t important enough to be treated as an organization, though it’d certainly be interesting. (Looking through the list, the flavor and the benefits of the dragon-worshippers would make sense for a draconic-themed line of kobolds, though I don’t imagine them as followers of the Dragon Emperor.)

**Is your character heroic? Would they lay down their life or otherwise make sacrifices for the greater good or to save another?**

Definitely, though he’s pragmatic enough to put in a good effort to avoid the dying part.

**What are their immediate goals? Are you seeking wealth, fame, glory? Are you after something more specific? Why?**

Varius is mostly seeking respect and glory for his people, and is hoping to do so by giving a good account of himself with the Black Wolf Irregulars. If the opportunity comes to acquire wealth or magical items to send back home, he’d take it as long as it didn’t dishonor his people (e.g., theft from non-Orcs).

**Is your character religious? The existance of the Gods is rarely disputed in Elthelas, but not everyone care to worship. Do they? If so who? (and of course, why?)**

No; he hasn’t seen the Gods as particularly involved with the lives of his people, and in this war there are Gods fighting on both sides - they’re dangerous, and it’s better to just go unnoticed. He’s a loyal servant of his people and his Queen, and that’s enough for him.

**Is your character merciful? Unforgiving? Temperate? Regularly Drunk? Scholarly? What character traits do they have that shape how they approach problems?**

He follows orders even when he doesn’t necessarily agree with them, because that’s his job. Outside of that he’s cheerful, inquisitive, selfless, and cares a lot about making a good impression on people.

Merciful unless it conflicts with orders; forgiving about personal matters; temperate; somewhat scholarly (definitely inquisitive, the kind of person who takes notes and keeps a journal).

#### Backstory

Silas grew up with his mother in the mountains of Staelia. His mother was an evil witch and while she loved him dearly, her punishments were severe, and he bears many magical scars from his upbringing. He learned to fight from a minotaur companion of his mother, Tarik Spinehoof. Tarik watched over him growing up. Silas never knew his father and his mother almost never spoke of him.

Silas left home after coming of age “to seek his destiny” his mother would say. He drifted from place to place, never putting down roots. Always a survivor and scavenger, not one to leave behind what might be useful later. He found bounty hunting to be a natural talent for him. He was extremely physically gifted and could wrestle most anything down and drag it back to the garrison.

During his drifting he became close friends with Lilac Blossom. Blossom was a local Priestess of Amathera he met in Gerasalim. On one of Silas’s trips through the area Blossom was raped and murdered by a Lord-General of the Rising Dawn, Sir Erik Dawnblade. Afterward her spirit came to Silas saying she cannot rest while Dawnblade goes unpunished.

Sir Dawnblade was most recently stationed at the Fortress of Light, leading the Rising Dawn there.  Silas found a few survivors who escaped who say he disappeared just days before the Fortress fell to the orcs, and no one really knows where or why.  Silas has arrived in Cur'Estan hoping to find clues to his whereabouts among the other Lords of the Rising Dawn. Meanwhile, his mother's sendings have been... odd of late.  She has been known to wax prophetic from time to time, but she keeps talking about some halfling Sherriff and an Orc who plays bagpipes and how 'they will be pivotal in the events leading to the demise of your enemy'.  These sendings are always followed closely after by admonitions to change into clean underwear.

#### Backstory

Flykr Moon was born in Staelia. She is the third child of the local seamstress, Miriam Corneztra. Miriam’s husband Marius Corneztra died in an accident as he was traveling from Staelia to a nearby city. He was alone and it is still unknown what had caused the accident. Miriam, being a beautiful woman, was sought after by many suitors within the village, but no one seemed to catch her fancy. Until the mysterious stranger, Ta’Mahln Moon arrived. He was a member of the Church of Molton and sent to the village to find a wife and start mission for the church within the town. Miriam fell hard and fast for the handsome man, and he seemed to love her as much in return. After they were married, much to her children, Malick and Keera Corneztra’s, distress, the four moved into the house attached to the building that would become the Church of Molton. The two siblings felt something was off with the stranger and did not trust him. It wasn’t until after they were married that he told her he was unable to give her another child, and convinced her to go with him to the next town’s Church of Molton to pray to their God for help. Naturally, Molton was eager to help the two, taking Miriam back to his palace. A few days later, she returned to her home in Staelia, announcing to her husband and children she was pregnant. Thus, Flykr Moon came to be. 

Ta’Mahln and Miriam doted upon all three children, but it was clear Ta’Mahln loved Flykr above all others, including his own wife. Miriam did her best to be a fair and compassionate mother to all three. Her half-siblings, Malick and Keera, however, hated Ta’Mahln. Keera hated Flykr just as much. Malick, however, felt a need to protect his youngest sister. He was kind to her and often stood against Keera when she would go after Flykr in jealousy fueled rage. 

Despite being spoiled by her step-father and hated by her sister, Flykr grew to be a very kind, patient, friendly young woman. She was seen by many of the boys, and men, in her village as utterly beautiful. And by many of the girls, and some of the women, as devastatingly elegant. She made friends rather easily, but the same could be said about rivals and enemies as well. A young human boy, Silas (Mark’s character), was one being she counted as friend. He lived in the same village, just down the way from where she grew up. His mother was dear friends with Miriam, so the two kids knew each other rather well.

As she grew, Flykr’s affinity for performance arts, especially dance and rhythmic music, became more obvious. She seemed to be completely in tune with her body and her surroundings. It was as if she could feel the rhythm of the natural world around her and find the music to which she danced anywhere. Her father and mother both nurtured her natural abilities and talents, eventually enrolling her into dance and music classes as early as possible. When she was 13 years old, she met Gazelle, a famous dance instructor. Gazelle was stern and unrelenting in her teachings, but she was the best teacher Flykr could have ever asked for. She pushed Flykr harder than anyone else, because she knew the potential the Child of Molton had. 

Gazelle’s daughter, Jazelle, however, despised Flykr. Jazelle had been the outstanding student in the dance school before Flykr arrived, and was quickly replaced once Flykr’s passion was ignited fully. Jazelle declared to one day see Flykr loose her ability to capture everyone’s attentions and admirations. She was a jealous and angry woman.

Growing up as one of the few Children of Molton in a village like Staelia was always a struggle for Flykr. Sometimes it was hard to tell if a person, especially boys/men, truly enjoyed her company and liked her as the person she was, or if they were just infatuated with her appearance and racial reputation. She had many would-be suitors pounding on her family’s door when she was finally old enough to be courted. At first the idea of being so well desired was something she enjoyed, but soon, it became more taxing and upsetting than anything. More often than not, her suitors merely wished to sleep with her with the intention of having the best bar room scandal. She learned her lesson on that rather quickly.

But occasionally, she did find someone who truly wanted her. In some manner, anyway. A year before she left to attend the prestigious Bard College of Glamour, Flykr met Keiran Mikleson. He was desperately in love with her, to the point of becoming very controlling and overprotective. They only courted for a short time, but during that time, he tried to convince her to forget about dancing and becoming a Bard, for him. He tried to express that she would never be safe unless she was with him and when it became clear he could not manipulate her, and that she was going to leave him to go to the College, he hired a couple of men to scare her back to him. The men ambushed her in an alley, but were not prepared for what they found. It was never a well discussed fact. Ta’Mahln had taught his step-daughter how to wield daggers and a rapier for defense. And with her natural dexterity and grace, she was quite formidable with the weapons. She sent the men back to Keiran with a message that she would never go back to him and he should move on.  

At the Bard College of Glamour, Flykr met a Thomas Marcellus, a blind Elf who could spin the most amazing tales of love and romance. The two became dear friends, and are still in touch to this day. While she was at College, she met a kind Half Orc named Barbarious. Though he was a bit ill-suited as a Bard, he was still a decent being, and Flykr enjoyed his company. During their time together, Flykr began to realise Barbarious wasn’t happy at the College, he felt he didn’t quite fit in. And in truth, he didn’t. So Flykr did her best to help him come to terms with the idea that he didn’t want to be there and therefore shouldn’t be there. 

During her last year at the College, Flykr was approached by Carter Gold, an Elven merchant who recruited for the Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Artisans. It was known that Flykr was looking for a means to make her dancing profitable. They were looking for a peddler who was easy on the eyes and exuded confidence. Flykr enjoyed the freedom the Guild granted her, and the chance to meet with beings of all walks of life. Mostly, she sells and mends dance costumes (her mother being a seamstress, she developed a basic skill in sewing) and she has been know to be able to help beings find musical instruments, music, books and the like.

After graduating from the College of Glamour, Flykr took to travel. She often managed to book passage on ships by being the Dancing Entertainment. Some of the first places she visited Dera Dagoram, The Fortress of Light, and a few others. It was in Dera Dagoram that she met Eobard. He was part of the audience one night as she performed on a vast stage for all to witness. 

Throughout her travels, Flykr has met many beings. Which has been both a blessing, and a concern. When one lives a life of adventure, following one’s heart in an effort to seek love, admiration and fulfillment, one can sometimes become forgetful. This is the case with a being named Carlyle. Carlyle claims to have seen Flykr dancing in a grand palace a few years back. He approached her after her performance, buying her a drink and chatting her up. According to him, the two had a wonderful night together. But the next morning, he was sent on his way by his employers and was forced to leave her behind. But he has never forgotten her. Flykr, unfortunately, did forget Carlyle. For try as she might, she could not remember anything about the performance as some unnamed palace. She couldn’t recall a being buying her a drink. And she definitely did not remember spending some incredible night with said being. In fact, the only reason she knows any of this is from the letters Carlyle sends her. Somehow, no matter where she is or what she is doing, she still receives letters from Carlyle confessing his undying devotion to her and how he will find her again, someday. These letters find her via a large, black raven at least once every other week. Flykr is torn between wishing she could remember this man and their shared night, and finding the whole thing just a bit creepy. But he has never done or said anything to suggest he wishes her any ill-will. And with every letter, he shares that he somehow knows her very well. He has even hinted that he has seen her recently, but didn't have the opportunity to approach her and rekindle their connecting. So she gladly accepts the letters, sends some favor in return and keeps Carlyle’s letters in a special locked box at the bottom of her back pack.

#### Backstory

Tilda is a 24 year old human wizard from Kandor.  Around 5 years ago, Tilda was working in a book shop when she was framed for a for the murder of Duke Sebastian Mathis, Lord of Westport. The book shop owner, Eduard was not so lucky as to escape. Tilda managed to escape Kandor before she was arrested and executed, and she fled to Dormania.  Tilda was forced to live a nomadic existence as a fugitive, constantly moving from town to town, with detailed wanted posters of her face and alleged crime always dogging her steps.  She took occasional odd jobs, and stole when necessary to survive.  Once her street smarts improved and she developed a routine, Tilda's focus turned from survival to revenge.  She joined the Black Sun in Farengar, hoping to eventually hunt down the person or persons responsible for framing her.  At this point, she realizes it is futile to try to clear her name or get her old life back.  Justice under the law is a pipe dream.  The only thing left for her is vengeance.  She runs around disguised as a man and calls herself Fallon.  She wears baggy clothes and an occasional fake beard, and she compensates for her feminine features with over the top, stereotypical masculine  behavior.  Scratching, spitting, cursing, drinking, etc. She's developed quite the alcohol tolerance this way, as she engages in frequent drinking contests.  (Bascially if Gaston does it, Tilda does it).

Her mentor, Sarkis, as someone who doesn't share your wizardly skills, felt she needed someone who could help her grow her particular skill set.  He recommended she and her friend Yeva go to Cur'Estan to work with Kyman Hexhammer, a renowned Black Sun guild master originally from Curinor and a skilled wizard.

#### Backstory

His parents would travel the land performing music, so he never really had a land to call "home". After hearing a great warrior play the bagpipes before entering battle, Barbarious wanted to play them. His father enrolled him in the same college as Flyker Moon (he did not know her at the time), in hopes that he would realize the faults in his instrument and play the lute like a true bard. While Barbarious could play a tune, and sometimes even out perform his fellow classmates, his inconsistancy and random chaotic solos caused him to fail. When he was finally kicked out of school, he searched for the bagpipe playing warrior. He spent many nights listening to the winds hoping that the beautiful sound would fill his ears. After almost giving up on his dreams, he threw his bagpipes in the trash below his window. A few moments later he heard his bagpipes playing the unforgettable tune he'd heard as a child. Barbarious ran to the alleyway and met the Orc barbarian, Mugg. They spent many years together learning music and battle tactics. Mugg eventually had to travel for a large battle overseas, and recommended the Masters of the Deep for a place of worship and music. Barbarous reluctantly took his advice, and sought out the pale, Dwarves, subterranean land. Although many would find it hard to believe, they accepted him quickly as one of their own. That's what he's been up to.

#### Backstory

Eobard Thawne was a member of the ambassador's guard. Involved in a battle in which he nearly lost his life. He was hurried to a healer and saved. Since then, Eobard has felt that he was saved for a reason, that he didn't die so he could take justice into his own hands and protect those that couldn't protect themselves. He decided to become devoted to the Oath of Vengeance and the gods that he knows kept him alive to serve his new purpose. He has traveled since then, looking for people to help along the way. At one point while staying at a tavern in Dera Dagoram, he was witness to a wonderful performance led by Flykr. Having a love of music and his own talent in percussion, the pair stayed up late, talking and enjoying an epic jam session that many would have called a simple drum circle. It went until morning, and more than one patron grumbled about the noise interrupting their sleep. After moving on, Eobard eventually arrived in Cur'estan.

#### Backstory

Eadric Tudoria was born in the capital city of Geraslim (I'm assuming it's Strovenguard but I'm not sure). His parents were members of the criminal organization Black Sun, and would routinely leave Eadric and his younger siblings, Alex and Keyla, with a “family friend” and Black Sun fence, Eselred Lankshire when they were assigned jobs out of the city. One day when he was 13 Eadric's parents left for a job and never returned. To this day he doesn't know what happened to his parents, but he suspects that they are dead. After that he and his siblings where left in Eselred's care full time and he moved them to the smaller city of Linden, south of Strovenguard along the Dina river (At least I think it is still the Dina river, It's the one leading south out of Saria Lake)

Eselred had always been a cruel man, but after Aiden and Karla failed to return, he became much worse. Suddenly Eadric and Alex were put to work stealing in order to “pay their way”, while Eselred kept Keyla close to himself in order to insure the Tudoria boys' loyalty. The threat to his sister infuriated and terrified Eadric and in turn, kept him in line. Alex on the other hand, stopped needing the motivation and started looking to Eselred like a proper master and mentor.

Alex's taking to Eselred caused nothing but strife between Eadric and Alex, occasionally leading to physical confrontation. Years passed as Eselred took more interest in Eadric and Alex's training. Alex, the only one of the three actually loyal to him, excelled at the most brutal and deadly of lessons. While Alex was learning to kill, maim and torture, Eselred taught Eadric how to read situations , gather information, and forge documents. Eadric realized quickly that Eselred had intended to show him how little of a chance he had against the older man. Keyla was not allowed out of Eselred's or Alex's proximity, nor was she trained by either of them. She did however, come to befriend a number of local animals that would visit the house looking for scraps.

Eadric made plan after plan on how to escape the old man's grasp with his sister, who had begun to catch Eselred's eye in a newer and darker way after turning 12, but time and time again, Eselred proved to be one step ahead of him. Finally one day in early Trimalan, their house was raided by a joint force of local law and Strovenguard investigators. After a short fight, Eselred decided to abandon Eadric and Keyla, taking Alex and making a narrow escape, leaving the two to serve as a distration.

The two Tudoria siblings were taken into custody for questioning. After days of intense interrogation, the decision was made to send Keyla for adoption and imprison Eadric, who was 18, for his part of Eselred's plans. One officer, the sheriff of Linden Terian Tate, was not so sure that was necessary, and got both of them released into his custody in order to reform the Eadric and see that he served to make up for his crimes.

Despite his generosity, Eadric and Terian did not get along at first. Eadric had become hardened and suspicious by his years with Eselred. He didn't trust the older human any more than he could throw him, and Alex had always been the stronger of the two. Keyla on the other hand took to Terian like a father figure after only a few months.

As the years passed, and Eadric slowly warmed to Terian, the sheriff taught the two all the things that Eselred and their parents hadn't; compassion, trust, loyalty, and second chances. With her new found freedom Keyla started hanging around the stables, helping to tend to the horses, ponies and mastiffs, eventually learning the trade of breaking and training riding animals. Eadric started putting his information gathering and other skills to use helping Terian root out crime in the city and surrounding area. He proved to be a natural at it, and at the age of 22, he was officially named a deputy. On the day he received his new badge, Keyla presented him with another surprise, a beautiful long-haired black and brown mastiff named Scylla.

Life had finally started to get better, and Eadric stopped looking over his and his sisters shoulders constantly. And then the Fortress of Light fell, and with it, all sense of normalcy everywhere. Orcish invaders swarmed Linden on their way to Strovenguard, killing everyone they could get their hands on. Eadric and Keyla barely made it out alive. Terian Tate, having been out on rounds out of the city hasn't been seen since.

The Tudorias, now refugees fled to Strovenguard, then Northport, and finally Cur Estan. In Cur Estan they found the Blackwolf Irregulars recruiting and immediately joined up. Eadric managed a place as an officer in the organization, Keyla as a scout and messenger, having out ridden dozens of people for the position.

While going through training and testing to become an officer, Eadric developed an animosity toward his orc Drill Seargent, a man by the name of Gnar Locke. The dislike, fueled almost entirely on Eadric's new hatred for orcs and Gnar's dislike of the physically weak, almost caused Eadric to be disqualified for the position, and in fact would have if not for the desperate need for officers, and the direct intervention of Ninatha Quiverleaf, a Captain in the Irregulars and Gnar's direct superior.

He gets along incredibly well with a dwarf by the name of Arman Hammerfall. The two are both lieutenants and often seen bickering back and forth, just for the fun of it. Eadric became reacquainted with Nadir Highwall, a member of Cur Estan's law enforcment, one of the men who assailed Eselred's house. Nadir is wary of Eadric, but has enough respect for Terian's opinion that he has brought Eadric in to help with a few cases. To his surprise, he even ran into an informant from Linden, Hensen Darkshadow. The Tiefling, also a refugee now, has used the chaos dig in a make a little money here or there.

The only real silver lining for Eadric has been Ashes of the Mountain, or Ash as her friends call her. Ash is a female Tabaxi from a highly damaged tribe coming out of Gerasalim that sought refuge from the invading orcs. Eadric and Ash have begun to find solace in each others company and their relationship is slowly becoming something more than friends. Ash's father is none too happy that his daughter has been getting more affectionate with a non-Tabaxi given the tribes history with outsiders, but has had his attention diverted elsewhere due to the tragedies all around them.
