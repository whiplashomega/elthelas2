# Chapter 3: Civil War

## Encounters in Cur'Estan

<!-- TODO -->

## Orders

### General Heartbren's Orders

The influx of refugees has created a supply problem in Cur'Estan. In normal conditions we would transport goods via the Upper Yellow River from Cur'Mestin and the farming communities in western Dormania, but the Duchess of Cur'Mestin has blockaded the river due to our alliance with Empress Dormana. We need to end that blockade. The most likely route for success is probably to contact the Empresses loyalists in the city and find a way to break the blockade by force. 

#### Black Wolf Irregulars Orders

The last group I sent on this mission never returned, find out what happened to Silas of Irons, Flykr Moon, and Adam, the last delegation I sent to Cur'Mestin.

#### Inevitables Orders

The Temple of Alohim in the city has been taken over by a cult hoping to summon creatures from beyond the Planes. Destroy this cult and any creatures they have managed to summon.

#### Sylvan's Rangers Orders

Duchess Octavius has offended good people everywhere with her oppressive rule. Meanwhile her daughter is a good woman. Kill the Duchess and see that her daughter takes the throne.

#### Union of Wizard's Colleges Orders

There are rumors of a Purple Worm Nest near Cur'Mestin. Purple Worm eggs are incredibly valuable and rarely available for study. Bring at least one back with you and we will pay you well for it.

#### Potential Orders for Other Factions

Deal with river pirates

Expel the devils from the city

Kill a Purple Worm

#### Shepherd's of the All-Mother

We have heard of an unprecedented opportunity in Cur'Mestin! Take this scroll to the leader of the Shepherd's in the city. He will need you to find and kill one of the Purple Worms that live nearby. We will then raise it as an uber-powerful undead slave! One we will use to create a grand new system of underground tunnels for transportation to rival even the dwarves!

## Traveling to Cur'Mestin

#### Travelling by Boat

When the party arrives at the river, the first ship to pass will be a keelboat, moving slowly upriver (slower than they can walk) and laden with cargo. They will be unwilling to take on armed passengers unless convinced. There are two crewmen, Captain Jack and his first mate Sparrow. They are carrying food to Northport, grain and dried meat.

The next boat to pass is the galley of Captain Mercedes Hawk. She is a pirate and a slaver looking to sell slaves to the orcs.  All of her slaves are below decks, rowing the boat. They are travelling half-speed due to the current, but Mercedes will offer to put her crew on double shifts for the right price. She offers passage at 50 gp per person, or 75 gp per person for double time.

She has 10 crewmen including herself.

The ship has 2 levels below decks, the first is the cargo hold and quarters, players will be given rooms on this level (3 rooms, 2 per room). The ship is carrying some cargo in the form of spices (that Mercedes looted off the ship the slaves below decks came from.) The bottom level is the rowing deck, the 30 slaves down there never come up, and are only mentioned as 'oarsmen'. Mercedes will inform the party that it is off-limits, and the hatch remains padlocked at all times. Captain Mercedes and her first-mate Robert (also the slave driver) are the only ones with keys. The lock is a DC 15 slight of hand check to unlock (with advantage if proficient with thieves tools, must have thieves tools to attempt) or a DC 20 strength check to break.

If the party does not investigate the lower deck on their own, the following things will happen, one per day if travelling at double speed, or one every other day if travelling at normal speed:

event 1: The party hears a scream from below decks echo through the ship.

event 2: There is a loud splash in the night as a crewman dumps a dead slave overboard. He responds to any questioning with 'just dumping the garbage'.

event 3: Robert comes up from below decks still wearing his black mask and carrying his whip (which has blood on it).

event 4: Robert calls the captain below decks saying there is a 'situation'. When the captain returns she is cleaning blood off her dagger. (If the party investigates here it is a slave that got loose from its chains and is holding a crewman hostage and demanding freedom).

## Carlyle Pt. 2

Shortly after arrival in Cur'Mestin (before entering the city). A raven will drop the hilt of a rapier in front of Flykr, then land on her shoulder, a letter in a tube tied to it's leg (similar to a messenger pigeon). The letter will say:

My Dearest Flykr,

It has been my deepest honor to watch you these weeks. Your beauty and grace continue to surpass all others. Please accept this gift, when combined with the blade shard you already carry it will help to protect you from all harm. While a part of me is always with you, I must venture onward to Strovenguard. The Raven on your shoulder is my good friend Quothe, so long as you hold to the hilt of this blade he will serve you with loyalty, showing you all of the love that, for now, I cannot.

Forever Yours,
Carlyle

<h4>The Singing Rapier (2 pieces)</h4>

<p>When combined with the blade shard necklace makes a single magic weapon (broken rapier, functionally a dagger) that:</p>

<p>2/day grants a bonus to AC equal to spellcasting modifier, advantage on acrobatics checks, and an extra 10 ft of movement speed for 1 minute (as bonus action).</p>
<p>does 1d4 base damage.</p>

## Cur'Mestin

### Locations

![map of cur'mestin](https://elthelas-images.herokuapp.com/maps/cities/curmestin.png)

#### 1\. Octavius Castle

Octavius Castle is the home of Genevieve Octavius and the seat of government for the duchy. It is an imposing fortress built by Dorman I as a staging base before his invasion of Kandor. Genevieve has spent considerable sums repairing and restocking the fortress in recent years.

#### 2\. The River Docks

The river docks of Cur'Mestin are a singular large complex near the main marketplace in the city. There are several huge warehouses nearby currently filled to the brim with supplies.

#### 3\. Temple of Dorman

The largest temple in the city, the local priests of Dorman have not taken a side in the conflict between Manius Aquila and Empress Dormana.

#### 4\. Temple of Alohim

The Temple of Alohim is a relatively minor temple in Cur'Mestin, and the few regular worshippers that go there have been alarmed at the recent changes in the doctrine, not to mention the sudden disappearance of the high priest. The lower priests claim he was simply recalled to Desadorel, but his family is still in town, so most don't believe them.

#### 5\. Temple of Sara

The temple of Sara in town serves the local farmers without getting involved in politics. The local grange meets in the temple every Mansday.

#### 6\. Temple of Maris

The priests of the temple of Maris have been vocal in their opposition to civil war, and particularly the blockade of Cur'Estan.

#### 7\. Loyalist's Hideout

Genevieve the Younger's loyalists meet in this restaurant to discuss plans to undermine the rebels. They regularly speak in codewords and passphrases, and most anyone who frequents the restaurant is aware that something fishy is going on with the duchesses daughter.

#### 8\. Purple Worm Nest

A few miles to the east of town, some miners accidentally broke through into a purple worm's nest a few months ago. The mine was abandoned after that, and various monsters have moved in instead.

### Important People

#### [Genevieve Octavius](/runner/genevieveoctavius).

The Duchess of Cur'Mestin was an early supporter of Manius Aquila. She has always been known as a power hungry woman. The third (and least favored) child of her father, the previous Duke Octavius, she had her elder siblings murdered in their sleep (although it was never proven). Then, frustrated by her father's continued long life, waited until he slighted her at a party, then challenged him to a duel. She defeated her father in 'fair' combat after he tripped on something he couldn't see, inheriting his titles and duchy.

After rising to power, Genevieve proceeded to consolidate it, swiftly replacing the counts and barons under her with men and women directly loyal to her. Her largest frustration has been her own wayward daughter (and heir).

#### [Genevieve Octavius II](/runner/genevieveoctaviusii).

Named by her mother in a pique of vanity, the younger Genevieve became enamored at a young age with a local priest of Cora. That priest soon died in suspicious circumstances (after her mother discovered their budding relationship), and young Genevieve put the pieces together. Her uncle and grandfathers deaths, the disappearances among those who opposed her mother's iron fisted rule, and her own lover. When her mother pledged to support Manius Aquila's rebellion and began publicly trafficking with devils, Genevieve began quietly communicating with the Empress, and organizing a resistance force among the peasantry.

The younger Genevieve is bright and capable, but foolhardy, believing ever brightly in Cora's doctrine that no cause is ever truly lost.

#### [Felix Crawford](/runner/felixcrawford&shieldguardian)

Felix is a young half-elf with a questionable past. He regularly works for the highest bidder, sometimes as a spy, sometimes as a diplomat. He honors his contracts, but takes it very personally when someone else fails to honor theirs. Has worked with Kyman Hexhammer in the past, though they are not currently on the best of terms. He has a shield guardian companion that rarely leaves his side. He is currently in the employ of Genevieve Octavius to root out the loyalists.

#### TODO: Devil Second in Command

#### [Erik Dawnblade](/runner/erikdawnblade)

Erik Dawnblade, once Paladin of Alohim, now serves a different master. He has been working for Manius Aquila for several months as an enforcer, and is in Cur'Mestin for unknown reasons. This doesn't stop Duchess Octavius from making use of him when necessary.

## Entering the City

There is a toll to enter the city of 10 gp, plus a premium determined by the collector at the gate. Weapons, armor, or other potentially dangerous goods are prohibited, and those entering are inspected for such items. There are multiple ways to enter the city and avoid the tolls, (sneak in via the docks, go over the wall, through the sewers, a clever disguise, etc). SKILL CHALLENGE.

## Felix Crawford

The Duchess is not present in the castle, and Felix is handling her affairs of state, while being in direct contact with her via a hidden sending stone. Also present in the meeting are the Duchess's daughter Genevieve Octavius II, and Herad Paleleaf, the bounty hunter after Adam. The Duchess is scrying on the room, and has a sending stone to communicate with Felix. The Duchess will not agree to open the trade route unless the party brings her the head of the loyalists leader. It is obvious that she is working with devils, as the guards in the castle have all been replaced by bearded devils. During the conversation a functionary will butt into the conversation and report that some of the townspeople are protesting the recent tax increase outside the castle. Felix will respond that Sir Dawnblade is in town and dealing with those issues is his job. The functionary will then leave.

The Duchess, via Felix, is unwilling to end the blockade unless Cur'Estan disarms and swears loyalty to Manius Aquila. Felix will tell the party he has been informed of their high crimes. Crimes he is willing to ignore so long as they leave the city. These crimes are (and he will list them):

##### The One Calling Herself Fallon
Murder of the High Duke of Westport
kidnapping
theft
lying to an officer of the law
Conspiring with an illegal organization
Piracy
Murder of a Ships Crew

##### Adam
theft
fraud
smuggling
Piracy
Murder of a Ships Crew
Conspiring with an illegal organization

##### Silas of Irons
assault
espionage
kidnapping
Piracy
Murder of a Ships Crew
Conspiring with an illegal organization

##### Flykr Moon
theft
fraud
kidnapping
Piracy
Murder of a Ships Crew
Conspiring with an illegal organization

#### Non-Violent Option

If the party avoids violence here, they will be allowed to leave without trouble. Herad Paleleaf (bountyhunter after Adam) will approach them as they leave, and give Silas a note. The note says:

I can still get your crimes and Fallons cleared. Meet me at the Malin Bridge, turn over Adam and Flykr, and I will do what I can for you.

#### Violent Option

Should the party try to threaten or use violence against Felix, he and his shield guardian will dimension door away, Herad will leave via a side door, and the devil guards (along with the bone devil on the ceiling) will attack. Genevieve Octavius II will join the battle on the parties side.

#### [Run This Encounter](/runner/bonedevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&genevieveoctaviusii)

## Encounter with Erik Dawnblade

If the party chooses to investigate the presence of Erik Dawnblade...

Sir Dawnblade is in town to help deal with the loyalists. If things get bad he will skip town, but minor issues like peasants protesting he deals with without mercy. If the party does not intervene, Dawnblade will simply use his swords special ability to cast 'Dawn', laying waste to the peasants in a flash of burning light.

If they do intervene, he will challenge Silas to a one on one. Should he win (likely), he will spare Silas and leave. If the party attempts to intervene as a group, his bearded devil soldiers will help him.

#### [Run This Encounter](/runner/erikdawnblade&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil)

## Contacting the Loyalists

After the meeting with Felix, the younger Genevieve will talk to the party, either outside the castle (if they leave non-violently), or after the fight. She will ask them to accompany her, and says that she can help them. She takes them to a loyalist hideout outside the walls of the city (the party can retrieve their weapons on the way out if they left them). While there she will inform them of her plan, which is this:

1. The party retrieves a Purple Worm Egg from the nest.
2. The party sneaks into the castle with the egg, while in the castle they have 3 objectives.
* Break the imprisoned loyalists out of jail
* Get those imprisioned soldiers to the armory so they can steal weapons and armor, and assault the city from the inside
* Hide the Purple Worm Egg in the courtyard, attracting the Purple Worm to attack the castle.
3. The loyalists will then assault the walls from inside and out, attempting to secure the city.
4. When Genevieve (the elder) attempts to retake the city, fight from a position of strength to win.
5. Genevieve (the younger) will then end the blockade against Cur'Estan, and swear allegience to the Empress Dormana.

## Herad Paleleaf

Herad will wait for Silas at the bridge, sort of. He sends a simulacrum of himself (supplied by Haera) to the bridge. If (expectedly) the party either doesn't show up or refuses to turn over Adam and Flykr, he will let them leave and then ambush them from a distance. One Simulacrum will show himself and attack from ~200 ft away, attempting consistently to keep his distance, while another attacks from ~200 ft behind the party on a long open street.

## Orc Slaver's Seeking Flykr

A group of Orc Slaver's will (at some point), attack the party seeking to reclaim Flykr.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/orcbladeofilneval&orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orc&orc&orc)

## Help the Slaves

At some point a random man, dressed in rags and obviously recently whipped will run up to the party, and beg them to save his family. He will tell them they are still imprisoned on a slave galley at the docks, but will likely be unloaded and sold within a couple of hours. A slaver who is chasing him (a single bandit) will attempt to kill the man where he stands once he has spoken. The slave ship at the docks is similar to the ship they rode on to get here. It has a crew of 9 including the captain (not including the crewman who was chasing the escaped slave).

[Run This Encounter](/runner/banditcaptain&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit)

## Temple of Alohim

#### Password 

The barred doors of the temple have a single cultist “guard” that is supposed to let in other cultists. The password can be anything, but I recommend “Alohim sucks”. This password can be easily obtained by either hiding and listening to the password, or by finding any cultists and asking them nicely to join their cult, or interrogation. Or if the players are typical they will break down the door and alert the whole place at once.

#### The mooks

The top part of the temple has about 20 cultists looting the place and doing other tasks, such as practicing rituals to summon devils, preaching the glory of whatever devil they are following, or cleaning up after previous tasks. If the door is broken down most of them fight for only one round before retreating downstairs.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist)

#### The Spectator

Being at least somewhat competent, the cultists managed to summon a spectator. This is where the cultists will retreat to. The spectator will fight to the death, but the cultists will again retreat after one round of combat. Cowards.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/spectator&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist)

#### The Manticore

The cult leader has a pet manticore that he has guarding the door so the idiot cultists don’t bother him or set off his trap in the next room. Some cultists ran straight here but were too afraid of the manticore to move ahead, and the others that ran when the spectator died are here too. The manticore of course fights to the death but make sure at least one cultists runs away.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/manticore&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist&cultist)

#### The Trap 

The leader set up a glyph of warding on the final basement door to prevent his idiot cultists from bothering him during his work. If any of the cultists managed to escape this far, they all exploded. The glyph is obvious and simply explodes when the door opens. Players could think of at least a dozen ways around it.

#### The Leader

The leader is currently in the process of attempting to permanently mind control the temple leader. He has a penchant for exoitic pets and has a trained chimera with him. The leader tries to get the temple leader to also attack the players, but having the mind control not fully set in yet the temple leader gets a wisdom save each turn to end the effect, such as the dominate person spell.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/conjurer&chimera&priest)

## The Purple Worm Nest

The purple worm nest was discovered by some kobold miners (now all dead) in a mine east of town. It is a half days travel to get there.

#### Mine entrance 

The players enter the wormling tunnels through an established mine tunnel. The tunnel however has been weakened by purple worm tunnels in the area. The players enter through a normal cart tracked tunnel when the tunnel begins to crumble and they fall through into a worms tunnel. You can have there be a save for damage but since this is a scripted event I tend not to have that. The original tunnel they were on is now fully blocked and collapsed.

#### Worm tunnel 

All paths lead to the next eventually, but they players can choose their next encounter. In one path leads to a strange underground garden that has 2 shambling mounds that attack the passer’s by. The other direction seems to have small tunneler tracks in it, which leads to the grick layer.

[Shambling Mounds](/runner/shamblingmound&shamblingmound)

[Gricks](/runner/grick&grick&grick&grick)

#### More choices

The next tunnel has 3 branches each with different creatures for the players to find. Basilisks down one tunnel that can be detected by finding a miner that has turned to stone. Carrion crawlers which can be detected by seeing a few devoured corpses that have traces of the paralyzing poison on them. Or a couple bulettes that can be detected by noticing the type of tunnel has changed to be dug by a bulette.

[Basilisks](/runner/basilisk&basilisk&basilisk)

[Carron Crawlers](/runner/carrioncrawler&carrioncrawler&carrioncrawler&carrioncrawler)

[Bulettes](/runner/bulette&bulette)

#### Failed summoning 

The players stumble upon a recently wiped out cult of kobolds that were trying to resurrect their former master that died years ago. During their failed ritual they managed to summon a gauth, a beholder type creature that sneaks through poorly done ritauls. The gauth has resurrected some of the kobolds as zombies, and tries to devour the magical energy of the players. During the battle they can hear a loud commotion from the tunnel ahead that sounds like a purple worm fighting something.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/gauth&zombie&zombie&zombie&zombie)

#### The nest 

Within the nest itself there is a drider with a legion of spiders. Though the drider had a giant army of giant spiders to help they attracted the attention of a purple worm which they barely fought off with heavy casualties. One of the purple worms lie dead in its nest, it's body mutilated and unusable, the gems already having been looted and taken away. The drider wants the worm eggs for some reason, and does not take kindly to the players trying to take their hard earned prize.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/drider&giantwolfspider&giantwolfspider&giantwolfspider&giantwolfspider)

## Castle Octavius

Genevieve the younger has a number of loyalists who would aid her who have been imprisoned in the castle dungeon. She wants the party to free them. She can get them into the castle via a side gate, but then cannot be seen with them in the castle as she is well known and her mother is now aware of her treachery.

### Sneaking into the Castle

The party will need to sneak into the castle to move forward with the younger Genevieve's plan.

#### 1\. The North Gatehouse

The North Gatehouse is manned by 4 human guards, stationed on the second level. There is a small stairwell that leads up to that level on the ground floor. Their are several 2 foot by 2 foot openings in the floor of the second floor that they can pour boiling pitch down in the case of an incursion.

#### 2\. Barracks

The barracks is a two floor structure with sleeping quarters for the castles soldiers. The ground floor is general living quarters, with tables, chairs, storage, etc. The second floor is sleeping quarters, with a gender partition in the middle of the room. There are generally 10-15 guards off duty in the barracks at any time. Only the human guards stay in the primary barracks.

#### 3\. Corner towers.

The large round corner towers are manned by a mix of devil and human guards (3 of each per tower). The first floor is sleeping quarters and barracks space, while the top level is the watch post.

#### 4\. Commander's Quarters

The quarters for Genevieve's captain of the guard, he has been replaced by a chain devil, who has turned the quarters into his personal playground. Peasants, barely alive from torture, are chained to the wall, and chains hang from the ceiling throughout the room.

[Run This Encounter](runner/chaindevil)

#### 5\. Duchess Octavius Apartments

The apartments of the Duchess. The ground floor has living quarters and an office, as well as her daughters bedroom. The upper floor is the duchesses personal quarters, which remain locked at all times. Her communication stone is hidden under a floorboard by her bed.

#### 6\. Guest room apartments.

These rooms were once quarters dedicated to housing visiting functionaries, courtiers, and other persons of relatively high station. Today they remain locked at all times, and serve as housing for the Duchesses fiendish servants.

#### 7\. Great Hall

The Great Hall, where the duchess holds court, deals with matters of state, and hosts important functions. Excepting one of these functions the room generally stands empty, with Genevieve's throne of skulls at the head of the room, and a long table going down the center. The large stairway to the north of the Great Hall heads down to the dungeons.

#### 8\. The South Gate

The south gate is generally the receiving gate for visitors to the castle. It is less imposing than the north gate, lacking the flanking towers, but still has a double gate/portcullis and oil drop points from the second floor. The gate is generally manned by the Duchess butler and a pair of human guards.

#### 9\. Receiving Room

The receiving room stands just inside the south gate, and has another large gate on the far end for horses to pass through into the courtyard.

#### 10\. Courtyard

The open courtyard is maintained open grass for animals to graze. People living in the castle regularly pass through the courtyard on their way from one section of the castle to another.

#### 11\. Kitchens.

The castle kitchens. Regularly filled with servants and cooks preparing food for the various castle staff and soldier.

#### 12\. Pantry.

The storage space for the kitchens, includes the castles alcohol reserves.

#### 13\. Servant's Quarters.

The castle staff live in small apartments in this area.

#### 14\. Armory.

A storage area for weapons and armor. Guarded by a barbed devil and a spined devil (that the barbed devil beats up on for fun).

[Run This Encounter](/runner/barbeddevil&spineddevil)

#### 15\. Fletcher/Weaponsmith

The castle weaponsmith and fletcher works in this room with his apprentices.

#### 16\. Blacksmith

The castle blacksmith with his two apprentices has his shop in this room.

#### 17\. Stables

The stables of the castle, has 5 horses currently in stable, and a stableboy.

#### 18\. Square tower.

The four square towers are each manned by 2 bearded devils, armed with heavy crossbows as well as their glaives. The ground floor of each tower is unmanned storage space.

#### 19\. Guard's Room

The regular prison guards have been replaced by 3 barbed devils, who are busily torturing a prisoner. The guards room has several implements of torture, and a desk, where the keys to the cells lay. Hidden in the desk is an old prison register that lists the criminals in prison and their crimes. There is also a column listing planned release date, in which all of the previous writing has been scratched out and replaced with 'never'.

#### 20\. The Druid's Cell

The captured druid, Amra Olojeon, was thrown in prison for attacking a guard. She did attack the guard, because the guard was a bearded devil who was torturing some animals in her forest for fun. If rescued, she will point the party to the location of a secret stash outside the city where she hid her cloak of elven kind.

#### 21\. East Cell Block

The east cell block is completely full. 6 of the prisoners are in for treason (assisting the loyalists), 2 for contempt of court (looked at the duchess wrong), and the other 4 for various minor crimes (theft, breaking and entering, jay walking, trespassing). All are willing to assist in freeing the city.

#### 22\. West Cell Block

The west cell block is mostly empty, and appears to be reserved for more dangerous criminals. A permanent silence spell fills this cell block, slowly driving those who occupy it insane. The captured druid sits in the second cell on the right. A murderer, driven mad by his own thoughts, is scratching at the bars just across from her. A wizard who defied the duchess is covered in self inflicted wounds, and has written a treatise on magical theory on the walls of his cell, in his own blood. Two of the cells have been used by the devils to store the corpses of their torture victims, and are piled high with dismembered bodies. The smell of rotting flesh fills the whole cell block. The last cell contains a little girl, who is in fact a cambion in disguise. There is a single large, obvious switch that opens all the cells and drops the silence spell. If freed, the wizard (use the 'evoker' entry from Volo's Guide to Monsters), the murderer (use the 'gladiator' entry from the monster manual), and the cambion will all attack, both the party and each other, as soon as they are out of the cell block. The druid will assist the party in this fight if it takes place (use the druid entry from the monster manual for Amra's statistics).

## Freeing the City

## Genevieve's Counterattack

## The Duchess is Dead

The devils do not have enough manpower to enforce a true blockade of the city, but by blocking river traffic, they can prevent most trade, including with Cur'Estan. Genevieve the Younger will receive a scout report shortly after her mother's death that the devils are blockading the river, and will inform the party. She asks them to do one last favor for her, and lead an assault on the upriver blockade between Cur'Mestin and Cur'Estan, while she leads her men to attack the downriver blockade.

#### The Upriver Blockade

The upriver blockade is led by Ogrun Hammerfist, a cruel tax collector known to have murdered spouses and children of those who failed to pay. He is devoted to the Duchess, committed to her cause, and revels in causing pain.

Ogrun has 2 spine devils and a knight backing him up. The blockade point itself consists of a dam and lock system, with a pier and guardhouse at the locks. No ship is allowed to pass until it is inspected. If the duchess died, there are 2 bearded devils and a Chain Devil as well.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/ogrunhammerfist&spinedevil&spinedevil&knight)

#### The Downriver Blockade

The downriver blockade is set up similar to the upriver blockade, but is less heavily manned, and only by human guards. The site is led by a knight, who has 3 guards as backup. Most ships are allowed through after paying a toll and a cursory inspection.
