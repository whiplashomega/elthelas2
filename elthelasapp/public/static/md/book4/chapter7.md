  <h2>Chapter 7: Waelin Independence</h2>
  <p>
    The new elven kingdom of Waelin is willing to aid the war effort where Eldoran is not. They have requested our aid in diplomatic matters in return. I am sending you to Loridesa in Eldoran. Your mission is to infiltrate the court and find a way to bring an end to the civil war that secures Waelin's independence and, ideally, brings Eldoran back into the war as well.
