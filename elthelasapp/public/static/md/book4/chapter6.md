## Chapter 6: Halls of the Underking

#### General Orders

The intelligence you provided gives me reason to believe that the orcs are preparing to assault the dwarven holds. Bring this information to the dwarven high council currently in High Hammer and convince them to rejoin this war before it is too late.

## Missions

#### Black Wolf Irregulars

We hope to use this opportunity to place a spy in the halls of power of Curinor. Kyman Hexhammer, my spymaster has an old contact at the Black Sun headquarters in Highhammer, Ginmealine Bitterforge, who we would like to offer the job. Find Ginmealine in Highhammer and get her on board.

#### Inevitables

The ex-dwarven commander, Bratal Flathide, has betrayed his oath to Curinor and taken to banditry in the hills near Westguard, capture him and deliver him to justice.

-Kolyarut

#### Union of Wizard's Colleges

Our contacts in the area have spotted a Blue Dragon in the area, the body of a blue dragon contains a number of useful components for magical items and advanced ritual spells, find this dragon and return its scales, shock bladder, and a healthy sample of blood and brain here for study.

#### Sylvan's Rangers

The dwarves jealously guard the maps of the tunnel routes to their underground holds, these maps are a prize that the Rangers would pay dearly to obtain. Particularly there are rumors of deep delving tunnels filled with creatures never documented by anyone from the surface. Get me maps to those tunnels.

### Travel to Westguard

Margo is looking to test her new airship design, based on the airships from her homeland of Stagenheim. She has designed it from scratch based on her own observations. She needs a crew to help her with her test flight, (the ship crews she asked took one look at the airship and refused) and offers the party a ride to wherever they need to go in return for manning the ship as crewmen for the journey.

The ship requires party members to continually man various stations, including:

**Spotter** - Margo's pilot position has very poor visibility, she needs someone in the crows nest to call out directions

Regular check: DC 12 Perception Check to spot threats, and DC 12 Survival to point out the correct direction to go

Extreme Success: DC 20 Survival check to discover a faster route, increasing speed by 1

Bad effect on failure: Failure of perception check causes extra roll on hazards table, failure on survival check causes speed reduced by 1

**Coal Shoveler** - the forward momentum is produced by twin turbines that run off a coal steam engine, the coal shoveler is responsible for making sure pressure on the steam engine stays constant by watching the pressure gauge on the engine and regularly shovelling coal into the boiler.

Regular check: DC 10 Strength check, DC 10 Constitution check. 

Extreme Success: DC 20 Strength check, DC 15 Constitution check: speed increased by 1.

Bad effect on failure: speed reduced by 1 mph, gain 1 level of exhaustion.

**Air Pressure Controller** - The ship's altitude and direction are managed by enslaved air elementals kept in special chambers. The air elementals regularly try to escape by pushing against their containers. When they do the excess pressure must be immediately released using a special valve. There are dozens of these valves placed at difficult to access locations on a large lead wall.

Regular check: DC 10 Acrobatics check. 

Extreme success: DC 15 Acrobatics increases altitude by 1.

Bad effect on failure: ship repair reduced by 1

**Engineer** - The engineer is responsible for making sure the arcane engine that harnesses the power of the air elementals continues working. The engine consists of a large copper apparatus with hundreds of arcanum crystals aligned at particular angles. Whomever is manning the engine must make sure that the crystals stay in alignment as the moving ship constantly jostles them around.

Regular check: DC 13 Arcana Check

Extreme Success: DC 20 Arcana Check perfect alignment causes altitude to increase by 1

Bad effect on failure: altitude reduced by 1, speed reduced by 1 for that period

**Maintenance** - Beyond specifically the arcane engine, the steam engine, and wooden hull need regular maintenance to keep up repair

Regular check: DC 10 (15) Intelligence check (advantage with tinkers tools and proficiency)

Extreme Success: DC 20 (25) Intelligence check increases ship repair by 1.

Bad effect on failure: repair of ship reduced by 1

Multiple people can man a single station. This is handled as a help action, giving advantage on the the check. Each of the 3 scales (altitude, speed, and repair) starts at a value of 5, can get as high as 8, and dropping to 0 causes the ship to crash.

If the trip is taking too long to run, Margo will have a bright idea. She will ask someone to take over for her at the pilots seat, and will handle 'maintenance' duties for the round. 

### Westguard

Westguard is not particularly large or important as a town. The town is not immediately under attack or under threat when the players arrive, but like other towns near the war front, it is chock full of refugees. It has managed to stay supplied by trading with the dwarves, but the tunnels went suddenly quiet a week before the players arrival. Human caravans that go in are turned away, and no dwarven caravans have come out.

Westguard itself is tense, but there is little for the players here, with the dwarf tunnels locked and the orcs surrounding on three sides, there is no way out for the people of Westguard, but they remain alone and without a way to escape. If the players actually do try to seek out information on what people need in town, they almost universally say, 'a way out, to escape to the north'.

### The Kobold Mine Anatolia

Varius's mine has been looted and abandoned. His Queen has been crucified, her corpse standing as a stark warning outside the mine. Inside the mine is no one but an elderly kobold miner who managed to hide, Grimecrag. Grimecrag tells of a mixed force of dragonborn, goliaths, lizardfolk, goblins, and more appearing suddenly at the mines entrance led by a massive blue dragon. While the mines traps killed many of the attackers, unlike most would-be foes, they pressed on, killing any who opposed them, and capturing anyone unable to fight. When they got to the Queen, Grimecrag watched from a hidey-hole as they immobilized her with magic, and nailed her to a cross. Everyone else who lived was taken prisoner and marched west, into the mountains, speaking of a nearby location the dragon wanted to turn into its lair. All of these events happened on Coranus 16, Grimecrag has been living in the remains of the mine ever since, scavenging food from what was left behind.

### The Dragon Lair

The Dragon has taken over a myconid colony as its base, killing the vast majority of the myconids.

![Horroths Lair](https://elthelas-images.herokuapp.com/images/maps/dungeons/horroths-lair.png "Horroths Lair")

**18 & 4** The entrance area is currently being expanded and fortified by some of captive Kobold miners, who are chained together in a chain gang. The are watched over by a trio of Goliath Werebears, the first party encounter with the cult of Horroth. There are 3 doors out, 2 to the south, and one to the east.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/werebear&werebear&werebear)

##### Prison Wing

**33** This small hallway contains a giant bulbous mushroom. Walking close to the mushroom causes it to explode sending acid for 15 ft in all directions. People in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity save or take 4d6 acid damage (save for half).

**22** This guard room has 6 bugbears in it who are taking a break and playing cards, their loud laughter can be heard through the door. The room has 2 doors to the north and 1 leading east.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/bugbear&bugbear&bugbear&bugbear&bugbear&bugbear)

**6** This is the wardens room for the prison beyond. The warden is one of Horroth's children, a young blue dragon, who sleeps in an alcove to one side of the room, the keys hanging from one of its claws. The southern door is coated with the same fungus that fills room **19**.

**19** This room is covered with small blue-green mushrooms. When the head of a mushroom is jostled, twin whiplike appendages roll out from underneath it and attempt to grapple the offending party, who must make a DC 13 acrobatics check to completely avoid the appendages, or a DC 13 athletics check to pull away by brute strength. If they fail either check they are grappled and take 3d6 poison damage each round until they successfully free themselves, or if they attempt athletics rather than acrobatics they take the damage once but successfully avoid being grappled.

**2** This room is the prison room, where the dragon has imprisoned a number of animals it hopes to break and turn into useful servants. When the party enters a bugbear is talking to a giant bee in a cage in a not-so-sane way. If he detects the party, he will release the bee and command it to attack, but the bee will simply attack him instead. Besides the bee, there is a pegasus name Alli in a cage who has clearly been tortured. She tells a tale of once having been the steed of a mighty, if foolhardy, Paladin, who challenged Horroth to single combat. She thanks the party for her freedom, and tells them that should they take revenge for her fallen master from the dragons hide, she will serve them so long as they serve good and righteous causes. She has specially made half-plate barding in a nearby chest (room **36**). The bee, meanwhile, mostly wants honey.

Besides the pegasus and the bee there are a number of giant rats that have been infected with myconid spores and have gone feral, and an angry griffon.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/pegasus&giantbee&griffon&giantrat)

**36** This area contains the possessions and food for the prisoners. There are a couple barrels of honey, a set of half-plate barding made for a pegasus, and a bunch of rat poison.

##### Main Path

**5** The east door from **4** leads to the electromagnet room. In the center of this room is a super-powerful magnet. Anyone wearing or carrying with them metal armor gets pulled towards the center. They must make a strength check to move away from the magnet with the DC determined by the distance from the magnet. Anyone wielding a metal weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls with that weapon.

25 ft away - DC 8
20 ft away - DC 10
15 ft away - DC 13
10 ft away - DC 17
5 ft away - DC 20

Alerted by fighting in the front chamber, bugbear dragon cultists are waiting in sand filled sinkholes to ambush the party when they come into the room.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/bugbeardragoncultist&bugbeardragoncultist&bugbeardragoncultist&bugbeardragoncultist&bugbeardragoncultist&bugbeardragoncultist)

**29 & 30** This extended hallway has a lightning arc passing through the center between the two sections.

**17** This area is a giant sand trap. The floor appears to be normal sand, but stepping onto it reveals it is in fact a giant sinkhole.

**10, 21, & 35** This section is the werebear's quarters. A couple of werebears are sleeping soundly here and can be either snuck past or surprised (their passive perception while sleeping is 12)

[Run This Encounter](/runner/werebear&werebear)

**20, 34, & 24** The crossroads, to the west is the exit, to the southwest is the beasts wing, to the southeast is Horroth's personal wing and to the east is the general quarters. The crossroads chambers themselves are untrapped, but guarded by a werebear, a bugbear dragon cultist and 2 armored battle ogres in section **24**.

##### East Wing

**11 & 31** The East Wing is used to house Horroth's trusted staff. In this common area the goblins are holding a game of pigball. At the site of intruders they will attempt to scatter and flee.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin&goblin)

**23** The bugbears sleeping quarters, when goblins flee into the room the bugbears will grab weapons and attack. There are 2 bugbear dragon cultists and 4 regular bugbears in the room.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/bugbeardragoncultist&bugbeardragoncultist&bugbear&bugbear&bugbear&bugbear)

**32** The goblins sleeping quarters.

**9** The fleeing goblins will alert the werebears in this room who will attempt to confront the party. There are 3 werebears off duty.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/werebear&werebear&werebear)

**16** The armory. Can retreive a half-dozen fully charged lightning guns (6 charges each), various fits of studded leather armor and chain mail, and other mundane weapons. It is unguarded.

##### Southwest Wing

**12** Beast Tamers office. A number of small to medium beasts are in cages here, including a wolf, an eagle, a giant badger, and a few giant rats. The beast tamer himself is relatively non-threatening. Unlike the other servants of Horroth, he is a true hireling, hired for his skill at taming and training wild beasts, and holds no love for his master. He is a goblin and a coward, and under threat will offer to serve the party if they will spare his life and that of his beast trainees. If his life is spared he will warn them about the Behir in the next chamber. The behir is mind controlled with the help of an orb in the chamber, and is considered one of the dragon's greatest successes. The beastmaster will tell the party that Behir's are natural enemies of dragons, bred by giants to destroy them, and suggest that if they can break the mind control, the Behir is likely to immediately go after Horroth for revenge and ignore them.

**7** The Behir's chamber.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/behir)

**28** The location of the mind control gem.

**1** Ooze containment area. This area has a series of magical glass tubes, each containing a different kind of ooze.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/blackpudding&gelatinouscube&grayooze&ochrejelly&slitheringtracker&whitemaw)

**27 & 46** Spider den. This back hallway is filled with the webs of giant spiders. They will leave the players alone unless they purposefully intrude.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/giantspider&giantspider&giantspider&giantspider)

**15** If the party dealt with Horroth first, this room is empty. If not, Horroth, having become aware of the incursion into her dungeon by the party and deducing their goal to free the kobolds, has sent her son and her captains to intercept and stop them. Satura Kalmuc, Pargor the Mighty, Magog the Bloody and a Young Blue Dragon named Olatha confront the party to stop and kill them.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/magogthebloody&saturakalmuc&pargorthemighty&youngbluedragon)

**14, 13, 42, 30** This area is where the surviving kobolds not currently working have been relegated to sleep and live.

**43** The treasure room of Horroth's daughter Olatha.

Total value 33040 gp

##### Horroth's Personal Section

[Run This Encounter](/runner/battleogre&battleogre&bugbeardragoncultist&werebear)

**8 & 41** The antichamber. To the south twin gates block the entrance to Horroth's chamber, while to the north a series of trapped tunnels are designed to prevent unwanted visitors from reaching this location. The antichamber houses Horroth's personal guards, among them Satura Kalmuc, Magog the Bloody (leader of the goblins), Pargor the Mighty (leader of the Werebears), and a Clay Golem. If the kobolds were freed first, only the clay golem will be here.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/magogthebloody&saturakalmuc&pargorthemighty&claygolem)

**3** Horroth's chamber. Horroth spends most of her time here, though she has her own exit as well, through a sandy black wall. Should her son be killed with the party freeing the kobolds, she will retreat, taking her horde with her.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/adultbluedragon)

**45** The Teleportation Circle. Horroth chose this location for her new lair because the Myconids had already set up a teleportation circle, making it easy for her to transport her loot and all her minions here from her old lair.

**47** Horroth's horde. 0 cp, 0 sp, 57000 gp, 8000 pp. Turquoise (10 gp value) Blue sapphire (1000 gp value) Diamond (5000 gp value) Emerald (1000 gp value) A necklace string of small pink pearls (2500 gp value) Chrysoprase (50 gp value) Gold ring set with bloodstones (250 gp value) Smoldering Breastplate (Mithril) (1100 gp value) Potion of Superior Healing (800 gp value) Wand of Blade Ward (1000 gp value) Wand of Prestidigitation (1000 gp value) Scroll of Elemental Bane (400 gp value) Scroll of Bones of the Earth (1600 gp value). Total value 152710 gp

### Bandits in the Hills

Bratal Flathide runs a large company of bandits that have terrorized the entire area for some time. People in town know of him, but do not know where he is hiding. At some point while the party is out and about outside the city, a group of his bandits will attack the party. It should be an easy fight for them.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/archer&knight&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&bandit&archer&bandit&bandit&bandit)

Bratal himself rarely leaves his central camp.



### The Deep Maps



### The Tunnel Entrance

Asking around town, the townsfolk can easily point them in the direction of the dwarven hold entrance, but they all say its pointless as it is unmanned and impassible. If they players do bother to venture there it a massive magically enchanted metal door that prevents teleport or any entry. And indeed it is unmanned, no one responds to their call.

If the players are more persistent with the townsfolk, (Bribes, kindness, maybe doing a sidequest, being formal), the townsfolk know of a secret entrance that is suppodely to only be for dwarves that change their mind and wish to join the rest of them underground (this is what they are told, and it isn’t true, but they believe it.) They also learn this information if they waste time at the big metal door by a passer-by.

This entrance is a trick devised by the dwarves to kill bands of orcs. They expect the townsfolk above to eventually be captured and tortured into giving away this info. There are a system of puzzles to make it look like a true test of “are you a dwarf”. But they also don’t want it to kill a dwarf that might actually wish to return.

### The Puzzles

**Piano** - Behind a massive bolder, that only the strength of 10 dwarves could move (Cumulative DC 100 Str Check that some of the dwarves could help with). Lies a passage the leads down. Eventually they come to a lone piano. Next to the piano, drips water onto curved shapes that ring out a simple melody. Players must play the melody on the paino. If you need an example, here is one from undertale that I like. Again the dwarves could help with this one if need be, but they will not continue past this point. Once played a wall opens to reveal the next area, the wall that opens is not the one directly next to the piano, making finding the opening ahead of time rather difficult. Players attempting to subvert the puzzles will not be treated nicely later on, as they are being monitored.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baNrufyAza8 

**Musical Tunnels** – At the entrance to this tunnel there is a sign that reads: “To any dwarf that wishes to return; steal your resolve. There will be no turning back beyond this point. If you have any unresolved business on the surface, now would be the time. To anyone else, know that only a slow death awaits you below.” This is the point where any dwarf allies leave, not wanting to truly leave the surface forever.

Ahead the tunnels are Marked with seemingly random letters. A through G (Not in order). They twist and separate and reconnect. In front of each tunnel is a bell tuned to a particular note hanging from the cieling. It quickly becomes obvious that there is no exit. Even the passage that leads back to the piano is gone, almost as if it was never there. The do find In the center of this weave of marked tunnels a funnel-like tube that leads down, too small to even fit your hand in. Inscribed next to it is “The final note of our nations anthem must sound in this cave. But beware, for only death awaits those fail this trial.”. Which a simple history check will let them remember that it is a D Major chord, consisting of D – F# – A.

Each bell, when rung, takes a different amount of time to echo the note back through the tunnels. Singing any tune in the center of the tunnel makes the center ring out a note that is transcribed on the wall. Standing at the back of the cavern makes the note flat, and standing near the funnel makes it sharp. Though difficult, the puzzle could be completed with only one person running around singing all the notes. Again once all the notes are sung, a random wall reveals the next path.

For each bell rung that does not belong in the chord, a stone golem will step out of the wall and attack.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/stonegolem)

The bells are labelled A - 1 A# - 2 B - 3 C - 4 C# - 5 D - 6 D# - 7 E - 8 F - 9 F# - 10 G - 11 G# - 12, and each takes 1 round longer than the one before to echo around.

**History Lesson** – As the players move deeper into the tunnels they come to an opening with a history based puzzle. There are 5 slabs with names on them placed around the room. And on the big metal door there are 5 slots that the slabs could be placed in. The 6 slots have descriptions of historal figures of the dwarves. This is basic dwarven history, but orc raiders wouldn’t possibly know it. Some examples below.

The name of our god – Dorun Forgesinger 
(The last name is a trick to throw people off, it can be a nickname that people refer to Dorun as.)

The first Dwarven King – Curin Highhammer

The most famous dwarven builder – (Suggested names) Urmala Ashbender

The greatest champion of our god – Brehilda Leadarm

The most famous dwarven entrepreneur – Vagruth Axebraid

The most powerful dwarven mage - Ian Farbringer

A corpse also lies within the room, from a month or so ago, of an orcish spy that attempted to enter. A medicine check reveals that they died from poison. If the players enter all the slabs, but any of them are incorrect, the room quickly fills up with poison gas until they either die, solve the puzzle, or open the door some other way. Obviously, you cannot expect players to know these guys we just made up. But instead of having them roll history checks for each one (Though they can do that if all else fails). Have them instead describe how their player would know each one first. For instance, if a paladin describes their holy teaching of ancient heroes of gods, they are far more likely to know of Brehilda Leadarm. A wizard that studied at a college would know of the deads of Ein Farbringer. A very good description allows them to automatically succeed on a roll. Try and have each player do one.

**Poisoned Water** – Ahead in the tunnels there is a small stream of water with a sign that reads “Those that drink deep of the gifts of Dorun shall persevere”. Drinking the water forces the player to make a Con save against poison. Anyone resistant to poison automatically passes this saving throw. Anyone else must make a save or become poisoned in a special way. They feel foggy and light headed.

Ahead of that area there is a small field of mushroom that must be passed. Anyone with a decent nature check can determine that these are known as “Caverns peace” mushroom. A very deadly and very rare mushroom that only grows deep in the underground. The mushrooms release toxic spores if disturbed, but they lose their toxicity in a day or so after being picked, so they do not make a good poison. Anyone that drank the water and did not fail can breathe the toxic spores without issues. Anyone that drank it and failed takes 8D8 poison damage (half on a successful Con save.) Anyone that didn’t drink the water takes 16D8 poison damage (half on a successful Con save.)

**Statues** – The final puzzle leads them to a very very bright room. The first thing they notice is that there is an orb affixed to a stone pedestal in the center of this room that is giving off a permanent daylight spell. Even the players find it annoyingly bright.
The exit door has a pedestal that could have something placed on top of it before it, and 3 red crystals imbedded in the door. It reads “Where all dwarves feel at home”. In the room are six statues of dwarves, each holding an outstretch stone item.

A warrior holds out a war hammer.
A Farmer holds out a shovel.
A Minor holds out a pickaxe.
A Merchant holds out a bag of gold.
A Cleric holds out a holy symbol of Dorun.
A Scholar holds out a book.

Whenever one of these items in placed on the pedestal one, a loud sound is made, one that clearly indicates incorrect, like a buzzer. And one of the lights on the door turns on. The trick is that none of these items answer the question properly. The real answer is that Dwarves feel at home in the dark underground. Players must cover up the daylight orb to reveal a glow-in-the-dark crystal plaque in a recess in the wall. The plague reads “In the dark depths of the underground”. When placed on the pedestal it opens the door.

**Final Chamber** – The final chamber is a massive room, think airplane hanger sized, with a massive sliding double door at the end with the inscription “Highhammer Hold Eastern Gate”. One could easily fit an army in the room, or an invading force. There is also a small sign on the door that reads “please knock”. The trap that I mentioned is that this massive door does not lead to the city in the depths, it doesn’t lead anywhere. The players aren’t anywhere close to it in terms of depth at this point. The entire room is designed to collapse and crush an invading force that tries to force the gate open.

Knocking on the door has a dwarf wizard use Thaumaturgy to have his voice echo in the room. He will ask the usual questions, assuming the players can gain his trust, he dimension doors into the room. He tells players he can take them to the city, but they will not be allowed to leave, and they may be executed for trespassing, as the dwarves cannot risk the location, defenses, and strategy’s getting into the hands of the enemy. After answering any more questions he casts teleportation circle to take them into the city.

#### The Keep

 The players are lead from the teleportation circle, which is a heavily guarded secret, to Thornam Cavejaw, who is the one in charge of defense of the city. He is the wizards direct superior and the only one of the wizard can think of bringing them to. Thornam tells the players that the council probably will not listen to them. There is nothing they can offer to make them reconsider (Unless they actually have something that alludes to the Orcs plans, at the very least the dead orc spy had plans to use burrowing creatures).

Thornam is absolutely confident in the defense of the stronghold. The dwarves have set up tectonic sensors to sense any burrowing creature. And even if they got past that, the rock at this depth is so thick it takes specially trained creatures to burrow it, and even then, they usually give those creatures special equipment to do it. An orc army burrowing in would be easy to notice, and fighting the dwarves in small dark tunnels would only be a slaughter for the orcs anyways, as they have mastered this technique. The commander confidently says “There is absolutely no way any orc army could ever possibly get into this stronghold!” (It is very cliché to have the attack happen right as he says it, but I think it would be funnier if your pause for a little bit, then describe the commander being aware of the claim he just made, and nervously look around, before saying “See? I told you that nothing could possibly -”). Then the attack begins.

#### The Assault

A massive light fills the extreme dark of the depths, a single hovering point above the city. It slowly expands larger and larger until it is the size of a ship. The light dims enough to see a Nautiloid, an ship of the illithid, thought to be lost to time, floating above the city. The sides of the ship bears the colors and symbol of the prince of fiends. A lone mind flayer stand on the farthest platform of the ship, looking down upon the city, he wears a unique helmet with many eyes that are able to see in all directions. The ship continues to be surrounded be the bubble of the astral sea.

Orc soldiers begin pouring down dozens of ropes, using special hand grips that allow them to fall down a rope, and slow themselves before they reach the bottom. These grips are called sky grips, and you could perhaps have the players discover orc plans to have hundreds of these created, but for what purpose is unknown. The mind flyer above is giving out orders to the orc leaders below in the assault. So even though the orcs have just arrived, they fight and act like they know the city very well, able to predict dwarfs’ soldiers movements, able to set up mini-ambushes. The home field advantage of the dwarves is gone.

The orcs will move in battle squads through the city.

[Orc Assault Squad Type 1](/runner/orcwarcaptain&orcbattlesorcerer&battleogre&orctrainedberserker&orctrainedberserker&orctrainedberserker&orctrainedberserker)

Squad type 1 uses an armored ogre as a central tank in front. Once the Ogre engages tanky PCs, the Berserkers flank in to crush weaker back-line troops.

[Orc Assault Squad Type 2](/runner/orcwarcaptain&orcwarcleric&orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orcelitearcher&orcelitearcher&orcelitearcher)

Squad type 2 fortifies choke points, laying down barriers to create cover and then the cleric and elite guards lock down opponents while the archers lay into them from behind.

The ship continues to be in this bubble of the astral sea. Any ranged attacks that start from outside the bubble, lose all momentum once they enter it. Fireballs and arrows that attack the ship, stop in midair within the astral sea, as there are orcs still on the ship, whose sole job is to think the projectiles into stopping.

Once this starts going down, Thornam begins immediately relaying orders, completely ignoring the players. If they ask to help, he simply tells them to stay out of the way, as he believes they are somehow involved (Which they might be, the orcs needed to know the location of the stronghold in order to arrive there). If they persist, Thornam will order a rookie dwarf soldier to take them to the dungeons, then everyone except the rookie leaves. The rookie doesn’t care if they actually go to the dungeons or not, he just wants to not have to fight on his first day.

The players are left to their own devices on what to do. They can ask the rookie any questions they may have, but they will not be given any specific directions on what to do. If they flee, they may be lost in the tunnels for some time, and the dwarves might be defeated right here (Or the nautilod escapes at the very least.) The players are welcome to think of their own solutions to the problem, while not being given directions.

The main thing they must do if they are to stop the invasion is kill the mind flyer directing it. He alone maintains the orc strategy, he maintains the astral rift, and he controls the ship. With him dead, the whole thing comes crashing down. The nautiloid moves slowly through the city, dropping orcs into every street. The players can kinda predict the path of the ship, then attempt to find a building that will get them closer to it. Trying to use dimension door, or misty step to enter the bubble doesn’t work, as it is still within another dimension, though plane shift would work.

There are many ropes that are attached to the ship that the players could attempts to climb, though orcs would comes down the ropes to fight them. I think it would be rather interesting to have a combat encounter just on the ropes, as orcs attempt to cut the players ropes, swing down to meet them in combat, or maybe throw things at them from above (They don’t have arrows or oil prepared, as they figured people wouldn’t get this close to the ship.)

Once on the ship they can see a massive orc army within the astral sea. They enter the ship, the exit it to get into the stronghold.

The Mind Flayer is guarded by his two pet umber hulks. Additionally, at the end of each round (initiative 0) a random orc war machine creature will jump onto the ship from the astral sea and engage.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/mindflayer&umberhulk&umberhulk)

Once defeated the ship exits the astral sea, and is affected by gravity and comes crashing down on the city. The council easily sees they are not safe from the might and resources of the prince of fiends, and is willing to listen to the players and join the war.
