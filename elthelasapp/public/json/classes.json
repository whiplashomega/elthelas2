See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and below for the archivist spell list.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt first level you know three cantrips of your choice from the archivist spell list. You learn additional archivist cantrips of your choice at higher levels as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the archivist table.\n\n#### Prayerbook\n\nAn archivist’s prayerbook is a record of their studies and the key to their magic. Archivists use their prayerbooks to keep track of their discoveries and to prepare which spells they will be able to cast each day. At 1st-level you have a prayerbook containing six 1st level archivist spells of your choice.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe archivist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of archivist spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of archivist spells from your prayerbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your archivist level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have slots.\n\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd-level archivist, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination, chosen from your prayerbook. If you prepare the 1st level spell Bless, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of archivist spells requires time spent studying your prayerbook and practicing the gestures and incantations needed to cast the spell : at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your archivist spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and notetaking. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an archivist spell when you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast an archivist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your prayer book. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) as a spellcasting focus for your archivist spells.\n\n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\nEach time you gain an archivist level, you can add two archivist spells of your choice to your prayerbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Archivist table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your prayerbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar on page 114 of the Player’s Handbook, replacing the word “wizard” with “archivist” and “spellbook” with “prayerbook”)."},{"level":1,"name":"Polyglot","description":"Archivists traditionally learn several languages in order to aid them in deciphering old tomes and arcane scrolls.

Lore abilities are mutually exclusive – when you use a lore ability with another lore ability already active, the new effect replaces the old effect.\n\nWhen you use a lore ability, you must make a DC 15 Intelligence check as you attempt to recall information about the selected creature.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n* When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\n* You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size.
