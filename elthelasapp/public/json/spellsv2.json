A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p><p></p><p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p><p></p><p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p><p></p>"},{"title":"Planar Binding","source":"PHB.265","tags":["bard","cleric","druid","warlock","wizard","level5","abjuration"],"school":"abjuration","level":"level5","ritual":false,"castingTime":"1 hour","range":"18m","components":"V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)","duration":"24 hours","savestat":"Charisma","savefor":"avoid being bound","damage":[],"description":"<p>With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service.
