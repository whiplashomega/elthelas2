# Chapter 3: Civil War

## Preparation

### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders

The influx of refugees presents a serious supply problem for Cur'Estan, and our best route of resupply, moving supplies upriver from Cur'Mestin is cut off by the
rebels under Manius Aquila. You must find a way to get open a trade route with Cur'Mestin so that we can buy supplies. Negotiate with the local duchess if you can,
use other means if you have to, thousands of lives depend on it.

#### Amathera's Shield Orders

There are rumors that Genevieve Octavius may have made deals with devils, find out for sure if this is the case. If so, she cannot be allowed to continue in a position
of power and must be deposed or killed. -Malia Demonslayer

#### Black Sun Orders:

An old, associate, of mine has been seen in Cur'Mestin recently, apparently working for Genevieve Octavius. I doubt Felix is particularly loyal to Duchess Octavius, convince him to switch sides. -Kyman Hexhammer

#### Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans Orders

This embargo is an afront to the guild. Dormania and Kandor have had open trade relations since the schism! General Heartbren may be concerned about food, but this
embargo is much bigger than that. Several of the local merchants pooled their resources to order a special shipment of goods a few weeks ago that has been held up
in a warehouse in Cur'Mestin. I want you to personally escort that shipment back to Cur'Estan. -Kendrick O'mally

#### Lords of the Rising Dawn Orders

We have received word that the local temple of Alohim in Cur'Mestin was desecrated. Make contact with the local priest among the loyalists in Cur'Mestin, find out who
the perpetrator was, and see that they pay for their crimes against the High God. -Duke James Lightbringer

#### Shepherds of the All-Mother Orders

The faithful in Cur'Mestin have been under persecution by both the loyalists and the rebels. Make contact with the local cleric of Nera and inform him that he can bring
his flock to safety here in Cur'Estan. -Gimble Beren

## Travelling to Cur'Mestin

**TODO** Boat Details, slave galley, etc etc

## Cur'Mestin

### Locations

![map of cur'mestin](/images/maps/cities/curmestin.png)

#### 1\. Octavius Castle

Octavius Castle is the home of Genevieve Octavius and the seat of government for the duchy. It is an imposing fortress built by Dorman I as a staging base before his invasion of Kandor. Genevieve has spent considerable sums repairing and restocking the fortress in recent years.

#### 2\. The River Docks

The river docks of Cur'Mestin are a singular large complex near the main marketplace in the city. There are several huge warehouses nearby currently filled to the brim with supplies.

#### 3\. Temple of Dorman

The largest temple in the city, the local priests of Dorman have not taken a side in the conflict between Manius Aquila and Empress Dormana.

#### 4\. Temple of Alohim

The Temple of Alohim is a relatively minor temple in Cur'Mestin, and the few regular worshippers that go there have been alarmed at the recent changes in the doctrine, not to mention the sudden disappearance of the high priest. The lower priests claim he was simply recalled to Desadorel, but his family is still in town, so most don't believe them.

#### 5\. Temple of Sara

The temple of Sara in town serves the local farmers without getting involved in politics. The local grange meets in the temple every Mansday.

#### 6\. Temple of Maris

The priests of the temple of Maris have been vocal in their opposition to civil war, and particularly the blockade of Cur'Estan.

#### 7\. Loyalist's Hideout

Genevieve the Younger's loyalists meet in this restaurant to discuss plans to undermine the rebels. They regularly speak in codewords and passphrases, and most anyone who frequents the restaurant is aware that something fishy is going on with the duchesses daughter.

#### 8\. Purple Worm Nest

A few miles to the east of town, some miners accidentally broke through into a purple worm's nest a few months ago. The mine was abandoned after that, and various monsters have moved in instead.

### Important People

#### Genevieve Octavius.

The Duchess of Cur'Mestin was an early supporter of Manius Aquila. She has always been known as a power hungry woman. The third (and least favored) child of her father, the previous Duke Octavius, she had her elder siblings murdered in their sleep (although it was never proven). Then, frustrated by her father's continued long life, waited until he slighted her at a party, then challenged him to a duel. She defeated her father in 'fair' combat after he tripped on something he couldn't see, inheriting his titles and duchy.

After rising to power, Genevieve proceeded to consolidate it, swiftly replacing the counts and barons under her with men and women directly loyal to her. Her largest frustration has been her own wayward daughter (and heir).

#### Genevieve Octavius II.

Named by her mother in a pique of vanity, the younger Genevieve became enamored at a young age with a local priest of Cora. That priest soon died in suspicious circumstances (after her mother discovered their budding relationship), and young Genevieve put the pieces together. Her uncle and grandfathers deaths, the disappearances among those who opposed her mother's iron fisted rule, and her own lover. When her mother pledged to support Manius Aquila's rebellion and began publicly trafficking with devils, Genevieve began quietly communicating with the Empress, and organizing a resistance force among the peasantry.

The younger Genevieve is bright and capable, but foolhardy, believing ever brightly in Cora's doctrine that no cause is ever truly lost.

#### [Felix Crawford](/runner/felixcrawford&shieldguardian)

Felix is a young half-elf with a questionable past. He regularly works for the highest bidder, sometimes as a spy, sometimes as a diplomat. He honors his contracts, but takes it very personally when someone else fails to honor theirs. Has worked with Kyman Hexhammer in the past, though they are not currently on the best of terms. He has a shield guardian companion that rarely leaves his side. He is currently in the employ of Genevieve Octavius to root out the loyalists.

## Castle Octavius

### Diplomacy

When the players arrive at Castle Octavius they will be met by Felix Crawford and his shield guardian just inside the gate.

He will inform the party that Duchess Octavius is not currently in the city and will not be able to see the party. He does not know when she will be back. The party is welcome to try to convince him to turn here, but if they do not he will loose a bone devil and 4 bearded devil guards on them before walking out. The younger Genevieve Octavius will help the party defend themselves along with two loyal (actually human) guards.

Once the party escapes or the devils are destroyed, Genevieve the Younger will ask the party to accompany her back to the loyalist hideout, where she will give them more details on the situation in Cur'Mestin, and ask for their aid. 

## TODO - Finding the Duchess

## Rescue the Prisoners

Genevieve the younger has a number of loyalists who would aid her who have been imprisoned in the castle dungeon. She wants the party to free them. She can get them into the castle via a side gate, but then cannot be seen with them in the castle as she is well known and her mother is now aware of her treachery.

### Sneaking into the Castle

The party may at some point decide to sneak or talk their way into other parts of Castle Octavius, whether to free the druid imprisoned in the dungeon, assassinate Duchess Octavius, or steal something of value.

#### 1\. The North Gatehouse

The North Gatehouse is manned by 4 human guards, stationed on the second level. There is a small stairwell that leads up to that level on the ground floor. Their are several 2 foot by 2 foot openings in the floor of the second floor that they can pour boiling pitch down in the case of an incursion.

#### 2\. Barracks

The barracks is a two floor structure with sleeping quarters for the castles soldiers. The ground floor is general living quarters, with tables, chairs, storage, etc. The second floor is sleeping quarters, with a gender partition in the middle of the room. There are generally 10-15 guards off duty in the barracks at any time. Only the human guards stay in the primary barracks.

#### 3\. Corner towers.

The large round corner towers are manned by a mix of devil and human guards (3 of each per tower). The first floor is sleeping quarters and barracks space, while the top level is the watch post.

#### 4\. Commander's Quarters

The quarters for Genevieve's captain of the guard, he has been replaced by a chain devil, who has turned the quarters into his personal playground. Peasants, barely alive from torture, are chained to the wall, and chains hang from the ceiling throughout the room.

#### 5\. Duchess Octavius Apartments

The apartments of the Duchess. The ground floor has living quarters and an office, as well as her daughters bedroom. The upper floor is the duchesses personal quarters, which remain locked at all times. Her communication stone is hidden under a floorboard by her bed.

#### 6\. Guest room apartments.

These rooms were once quarters dedicated to housing visiting functionaries, courtiers, and other persons of relatively high station. Today they remain locked at all times, and serve as housing for the Duchesses fiendish servants.

#### 7\. Great Hall

The Great Hall, where the duchess holds court, deals with matters of state, and hosts important functions. Excepting one of these functions the room generally stands empty, with Genevieve's throne of skulls at the head of the room, and a long table going down the center. The large stairway to the north of the Great Hall heads down to the dungeons.

#### 8\. The South Gate

The south gate is generally the receiving gate for visitors to the castle. It is less imposing than the north gate, lacking the flanking towers, but still has a double gate/portcullis and oil drop points from the second floor. The gate is generally manned by the Duchess butler and a pair of human guards.

#### 9\. Receiving Room

The receiving room stands just inside the south gate, and has another large gate on the far end for horses to pass through into the courtyard.

#### 10\. Courtyard

The open courtyard is maintained open grass for animals to graze. People living in the castle regularly pass through the courtyard on their way from one section of the castle to another.

#### 11\. Kitchens.

The castle kitchens. Regularly filled with servants and cooks preparing food for the various castle staff and soldier.

#### 12\. Pantry.

The storage space for the kitchens, includes the castles alcohol reserves.

#### 13\. Servant's Quarters.

The castle staff live in small apartments in this area.

#### 14\. Storage.

A storage area for dry goods.

#### 15\. Fletcher/Weaponsmith

The castle weaponsmith and fletcher works in this room with his apprentices.

#### 16\. Blacksmith

The castle blacksmith with his two apprentices has his shop in this room.

#### 17\. Stables

The stables of the castle, has 5 horses currently in stable, and a stableboy.

#### 18\. Square tower.

The four square towers are each manned by 2 bearded devils, armed with heavy crossbows as well as their glaives. The ground floor of each tower is unmanned storage space.

#### 19\. Guard's Room

The regular prison guards have been replaced by 3 barbed devils, who are busily torturing a prisoner. The guards room has several implements of torture, and a desk, where the keys to the cells lay. Hidden in the desk is an old prison register that lists the criminals in prison and their crimes. There is also a column listing planned release date, in which all of the previous writing has been scratched out and replaced with 'never'.

#### 20\. The Druid's Cell

The captured druid, Amra Olojeon, was thrown in prison for attacking a guard. She did attack the guard, because the guard was a bearded devil who was torturing some animals in her forest for fun. If rescued, she will point the party to the location of a secret stash outside the city where she hid her cloak of elven kind.

#### 21\. East Cell Block

The east cell block is completely full. 6 of the prisoners are in for treason (assisting the loyalists), 2 for contempt of court (looked at the duchess wrong), and the other 4 for various minor crimes (theft, breaking and entering, jay walking, trespassing).

#### 22\. West Cell Block

The west cell block is mostly empty, and appears to be reserved for more dangerous criminals. A permanent silence spell fills this cell block, slowly driving those who occupy it insane. The captured druid sits in the second cell on the right. A murderer, driven mad by his own thoughts, is scratching at the bars just across from her. A wizard who defied the duchess is covered in self inflicted wounds, and has written a treatise on magical theory on the walls of his cell, in his own blood. Two of the cells have been used by the devils to store the corpses of their torture victims, and are piled high with dismembered bodies. The smell of rotting flesh fills the whole cell block. The last cell contains a little girl, who is in fact a cambion in disguise. If freed, the wizard (use the 'evoker' entry from Volo's Guide to Monsters), the murderer (use the 'gladiator' entry from the monster manual), and the cambion will all attack, both the party and each other, as soon as the cell block has been cleared. The druid will assist the party in this fight if it takes place (use the druid entry from the monster manual for Amra's statistics).

## The Loyalists' Hideout

The Loyalist's Hideout is an inn outside the walls of the city to the east. If the party agrees to help the cause, the innkeeper will comp their stay, drinks, and food.

Genevieve the Younger will tell the party that her mother has been slowly replacing the guards at the castle with summoned devils, and she believes both her mother and Manius Aquila are working for one or more of the Dukes of Hell. Most people in Cur'Mestin are suspicious of the Duchess, but she has violently supressed any and all dissent up until now. She asks for the party's help in overthrowing her mother, and promises to pledge Cur'Mestin to Empress Dormana, and open trade with Cur'Estan, if they help her. She presents several possible ways of removing her mother from power: Using the purple worms, assassination, or replacing her communication stone.

#### Using the Purple Worms

Genevieve the Younger tells the party about the purple worm nest discovered in the mine to the east, and tells the party that a Purple Worm always knows when an egg is stolen and where it is. If the party steals an egg from the purple worm nest and plants it in the castle, the Purple Worm will attack, potentially destroying the castle, but likely killing or weakening her mother and her devils. This would enable the loyalists to mop up the rest and take control of the town. See 'the Purple Worm Nest' below for details on the nest and using an egg to attract a purple worm to the castle.

#### Assassination

While Genevieve the Elder is no push over, Genevieve the Younger feels the party should be able to kill her if they can get to her. She suggests sneaking into the castle and taking on the Duchess directly as a possibility, the remaining devils would then have to be dealt with by the loyalists.

#### Replacing her Communication Stone

Alternatively if the party can sneak into the castle they could replace the stone that the Duchess uses to communicate with her demonic patron with one designed by a wizard working with the loyalists. They could then feed false orders to the Duchess, bringing her out of the castle where the loyalists (with help from the party) could ambush her.

#### Discovery

The next morning, Felix Crawford (assuming he has not already been eliminated by the party) will arrive at the hideout with a large contingent of bearded devils disguised as guards. He will inform everyone inside that the Duchess is aware that this is a rebel hideout and to surrender immediately or be killed (intimidation check by Felix, potentially opposed by parties persuasion check). Should that fail to elicit surrender by the loyalists, Felix will say that he can secure free passage out of the city if they give up their leader (Felix is lying). If combat breaks out, Felix will flee with his shield guardian via dimension door.

**[Run This Encounter](/runner/felixcrawford&shieldguardian&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil&beardeddevil)**

## The Purple Worm Nest

Mine entrance: The players enter the wormling tunnels through an established mine tunnel. The tunnel however has been weakened by purple worm tunnels in the area. The players enter through a normal cart tracked tunnel when the tunnel begins to crumble and they fall through into a worms tunnel. You can have there be a save for damage but since this is a scripted event I tend not to have that. The original tunnel they were on is now fully blocked and collapsed.

Worm tunnel: All paths lead to the next eventually, but they players can choose their next encounter. In one path leads to a strange underground garden that has 2 shambling mounds that attack the passer’s by. The other direction seems to have small tunneler tracks in it, which leads to the grick layer.

More choices: The next tunnel has 3 branches each with different creatures for the players to find. Basilisks down one tunnel that can be detected by finding a miner that has turned to stone. Carrion crawlers which can be detected by seeing a few devoured corpses that have traces of the paralyzing poison on them. Or a couple bulettes that can be detected by noticing the type of tunnel has changed to be dug by a bulette.

Failed summoning: The players stumble upon a recently wiped out cult of kobalds that were trying to resurrect their former master that died years ago. During their failed ritual they managed to summon a gauth, a beholder type creature that sneaks through poorly done ritauls. The gauth has resurrected some of the kobolds as zombies, and tries to devour the magical energy of the players. During the battle they can hear a loud commotion from the tunnel ahead that sounds like a purple worm fighting something.

The nest: Within the nest itself there is a drider with a legion of spiders. Though the drider had a giant army of giant spiders to help they attracted the attention of a purple worm which they barely fought off with heavy casualties. One of the purple worms lie dead in its next, the gems already having been looted and taken away. The drider wants the worm eggs for some reason, and does not take kindly to the players trying to take their hard earned prize.

## The Temple of Alohim

Password: The barred doors of the temple have a single cultist “guard” that is supposed to let in other cultists. The password can be anything, but I recommend “Alohim sucks”. This password can be easily obtained by either hiding and listening to the password, or by finding any cultists and asking them nicely to join their cult, or interrogation. Or if the players are typical they will break down the door and alert the whole place at once.

The mooks: The top part of the temple has about 20 cultists looting the place and doing other tasks, such as practicing rituals to summon devils, preaching the glory of whatever devil they are following, or cleaning up after previous tasks. If the door is broken down most of them fight for only one round before retreating downstairs.

The Spectator: Being at least somewhat competent, the cultists managed to summon a spectator. This is where the cultists will retreat to. The spectator will fight to the death, but the cultists will again retreat after one round of combat. Cowards.

The cult leader has a pet manticore that he has guarding the door so the idoit cultists don’t bother him or set off his trap in the next room. Some cultists ran straight here but were too afraid of the manticore to move ahead, and the others that ran when the spectator died are here too. The manticore of course fights to the death but make sure at least one cultists runs away.

The trap: The leader set up a glyph of warding on the final basement door to prevent his idiot cultists from bothering him during his work. If any of the cultists managed to escape this far, they all exploded. The glyph is obvious and simply explodes when the door opens. Players could think of at least a dozen ways around it.

The leader: The leader is currently in the process of attempting to permanently mind control the temple leader. He has a penchant for exoitic pets and has a trained chimera with him. The leader tries to get the temple leader to also attack the players, but having the mind control not fully set in yet the temple leader gets a wisdom save each turn to end the effect, such as the dominate person spell.

## Breaking the Blockade

Depending on how the party proceeds in dealing with Duchess Octavius, events may play out in different ways. If Duchess Octavius is killed, her devils will retreat from the city and begin a siege based around the checkpoints. If the party elects to attempt to open a smuggling route, the checkpoints will need to be infiltrated in order to allow goods to flow to Cur'Estan.

#### The Duchess is Dead

The devils do not have enough manpower to enforce a true blockade of the city, but by blocking river traffic, they can prevent most trade, including with Cur'Estan. Genevieve the Younger will receive a scout report shortly after her mother's death that the devils are blockading the river, and will inform the party. She asks them to do one last favor for her, and lead an assault on the upriver blockade between Cur'Mestin and Cur'Estan, while she leads her men to attack the downriver blockade.

#### Open the Smuggling Route

If the party elects to simply open a smuggling route with Cur'Estan, Genevieve the Younger will offer a plan for them. If they can kill the guards and the overseer at the two blockade points, she can have her men take their place. This will allow her to cause havoc with supplies for the castle, and also to send goods upriver to Cur'Estan.

#### The Upriver Blockade

The upriver blockade is led by Ogrun Hammerfist, a cruel tax collector known to have murdered spouses and children of those who failed to pay. He is devoted to the Duchess, committed to her cause, and revels in causing pain.

Ogrun has 2 spine devils and a knight backing him up. The blockade point itself consists of a dam and lock system, with a pier and guardhouse at the locks. No ship is allowed to pass until it is inspected. If the duchess died, there are 2 bearded devils and a Chain Devil as well.

#### The Downriver Blockade

The downriver blockade is set up similar to the upriver blockade, but is less heavily manned, and only by human guards. The site is led by a knight, who has 3 guards as backup. Most ships are allowed through after paying a toll and a cursory inspection.

## Miscelaneous Sidequests

#### The Special Shipment

The Guild contact in Cur'Mestin is a portly merchant by the name of Boggs Henkel. Boggs says he has ships ready to take the shipment upriver, and the party is welcome to accompany them, but before he does he needs assurances that the overseer on the upriver checkpoint has been dealt with. If the party has completed the smuggling route quest they can accompany the shipment back to Cur'Estan without incident.

#### Nera's Flock

The priest of Nera lives in a small home near the edge of town. He appreciates the offer of safe haven, but informs the party that several of his followers have been imprisoned for their beliefs in a small jailhouse in town. The jailhouse is only lightly guarded (2 guards), but he asks the party to free his people without attacking the guards. The party can attempt to do it via stealth, or they could potentially bribe the guards (who will accept as little as 50 gp to free the prisoners).
