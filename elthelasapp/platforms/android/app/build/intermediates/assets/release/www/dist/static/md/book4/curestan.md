  <h2 id="curestan">Cur'Estan</h2>
  <p class="row"><img src="/static/images/maps/cities/curestan.png" alt="Map of Cur'Estan" class="col-sm-12" id="curestanmap" /></p>
  <p>Cur'Estan was once the fortress capitol of an ancient minor Kandori king, destroyed by Dorman I and left as a ruin in the woods.  20 years ago the Black Wolf Irregulars rebuilt the central castle to serve as their headquarters, and over the twenty years since a small town has sprung up around the castle serving the needs of the castle.  Over the last year, as the orcs have ravaged Demal'Thor, and then moved into Gerasalim, refugees have slowly trickled into the town.  A refugee camp has sprung up on the outskirts, now threatening to outnumber the original residents.</p>
  
  <p>The de facto ruler of Cur'Estan is General Gerad Heartbren of the Black Wolf Irregulars.  He commands the castle, and roughly 2000 soldiers, the last remains of the Black Wolf Irregulars forces.  </p>
  
  <p>The massive castle, with it's 30 ft thick walls, and 100 ft tall keep towers over the town in the west.  It contains large storehouses, stables, smiths, and fletchers who supply the soldiers.
  </p>
  <p>The town itself is dominated by the large stone embassy buildings, one for each of the Alliance nations, Kandor, Gerasalim, Dormania, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran.  Today only the Kandori Embassy is occupied, the rest have been abandoned, with only a caretaker cleaning crew assigned by Gerad to keep them from falling into disrepair.  The streets of the town are winding and haphazard.  The town was built quickly, with no particular plan, as merchants and tradesmen gravitated towards the town to fill the needs of the castle garrison and soldiers stationed there. The area directly in front of the castle gate is kept clear except in the mornings, when the merchants from the town, farmers, and hunters from the surrounding area set up temporary stands to sell goods.</p>
  <p>
    To the south of the castle is the barracks of the Black Wolf Irregulars, approximately 1500 soldiers stay in the barracks (in addition to the 500 or so garrisoned in the castle).  The area west of the barracks is used as a training ground.
  </p>
  <p>To the south of the town is the refugee camp, housing about 1000 refugees, managed by a contingent of Amathera's Shield, about 50 strong.  The refugees are welcome in town, and occasionally one will have the funds to build a proper house in the town itself, the rest are housed in large tents in the camp, each housing as many as 50 people.</p>
  <p>
    The southeast, between the town and the refugee camp, sits the permament complex of the Lords of the Rising Dawn.  An order of knights and paladins headquartered in Kaland.  The order has approximately 1000 soldiers garrisoned here in 4 large barracks buildings.

  <h3>Important People in Cur'Estan</h3>
    <h4>Gerad Heartbren</h4>
    <p>
      The now aging Moon Elf general is a gifted strategist and the de facto leader of the resistance forces, as they have come to be known since the dissolution of the Alliance.  His tribe was wiped out by the Orcs shortly after the fall of Aridhem, while he was commanding troops at the Fortress of Light, then he was reassigned to Cur’Estan shortly before the Fortress of Light’s own fall.  He blames himself for not being present for either battle, and is now determined to do better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Goals: </strong> Gerad, as one of the few surviving moon elves of influence, is particularly concerned about finding and protecting any Moon Elf refugees he comes across.  He wants to see the Orcs removed from his homeland of Demal Thor. He was a young adventurer when the Alliance of 6 Nations was formed, and was an early believer in the future of peaceful relations.  He wants to see the Alliance come back together, and even bring in more members if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Gerad holds a strong distaste for slavery and anything that shares similarities to it, such as serfdom or wage slavery.
    </p>
    <h4>Duke James Lightbringer</h4>
    <p>
      Cleric of Alohim, Ambassador of the King of Kandor, and Commander of the Kandori armies in the east, Lightbringer is a leader of the Lords of the Rising Dawn.  He has a thousand Kandori soldiers at his command, and a contingent of skilled Paladins dedicated above all to wiping out the Orcs.  Despite all the setbacks, General Lightbringer remains constantly optimistic about their chances of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Goals: </strong> Duke Lightbringer is a loyal vassal of the Kandori king, and will not rebel against his leige lord.  He is dedicated to ensuring the security of Kandor's borders, and wants to wipe out the Orc race. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Duke Lightbringer is a strong believer in the divine right to rule, and does not like that a common born person such as General Heartbren is in command at Cur'Estan.  He hates non-humans, particularly the green-skin races such as orcs and goblins, but has no love lost for elves, dwarves, halflings, or gnomes either.
    </p>
    <h4>Master Bard Haera Oelefros</h4>
    <p>
      Haera Oelefros has led the Makers of Legend in Kandor for 15 years, and is convinced that the next grand story for the ages will come from the exploits of the resistance members.  She has brought a small contingent of bards with her to document what is going on, embedding them in various units she hopes will prove legendary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haera actually has very little stake in the outcome of the war (or so she believes).  She is originally from Dera'Dragorim, and has been in Kandor so long only because she became engrossed in collecting the war stories of returning veterans.  She is tired of writing down other people's tales however, and is determined to be the hero of the next story she writes, no matter what it takes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Goals: </strong> Write the next major epic poem, preferably featuring herself as the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Anyone who she thinks is more important than her.
    </p>
    <h4>Kyman Hexhammer</h4>
    <p>
      The Black Sun leader from Stromforde was appalled at the Dwarves decision to withdraw from the war.  He may not care about nations, unity, or goodness, but the destruction wrought by the Prince of Fiends and his Orc armies has made the ‘legitimate’ acquisition of wealth difficult.  He now uses his many connections to recruit spies and assassins for the resistance, for a fee of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyman is very aware of the threat that the Orcs pose, and believes that no elf, dwarf, human, halfling, or gnome is safe from them.  He is incredibly angry with the dwarves for withdrawing from the active war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyman is a skilled, if rather amoral, wizard specializing in magical constructs and enchantment magic (the mental kind).  He rose through the ranks of the Black Sun through clever manipulation, crafty schemes, and secret betrayals of those who outranked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Goals: </strong> Get filthy rich, make sure the Resistance has enough money and resources to make him filthy rich. Convince the dwarves to rejoin the war effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dislikes:</strong> People who worry too much about honor and let it get in the way of getting things done (or his future wealth).  Anyone who fails to pay him for services rendered.
    </p>
    <h4>Quartermaster Wyrmling Trapsmith</h4>
    <p>
      The tiny kobold quartermaster was once an Orc slave before escaping.  He has proven himself incredibly adept at numbers and organization of supplies.  He is incredibly loyal to General Heartbren, who liberated his mine from the orcs.  His clan now controls a silver mine in the Dragons Teeth Mountains, just on the Demal'Thor side of the border.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he is the quartermaster, he doesn't do any lifting himself.  He has employees for that.  He himself is in charge of numbers, inventory, and sales.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Goals: </strong> Secure a ready supply of food and weapons for Cur’Estan.  Make sure the number of mouths to feed doesn’t exceed the available supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dislikes: </strong> Refugees (or anyone) who doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the community.
    </p>
    <h4>Margo</h4>
    <p>
      No one really knows much about Margo except that she showed up in town about a month ago and quickly showed off a skill in magic no one else in town had.  She set up shop selling magic items for a premium price.  She seems to dislike personal attachments, and never really visibly leaves her house/shop.  No one really knows where she gets materials, where she stores her goods for sale, or really anything else about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality Margo is an archmage from Stagenheim who has been travelling the world selling magical items for years.  For safety she does not keep any of her stock on this plane of existence, a tactic she started when she tried for a time to run her business via mail-order catalog.  She is deeply concerned by the Prince of Fiends success, and so has decided to ply her trade among those most likely to do some good in the fight against him.  She has no desire to get into any sort of combat herself, but will defend her shop if it is attacked.
    </p>
    <h4>Jaxan Chin</h4>
    <p>
      Jaxan is a cleric of Amathera, and the local leader of Amathera's Shield, the organization running the refugee camp.  Jaxan is not actually a particularly skilled or important cleric, but Amathera's Shield is short-handed in the extreme, and he was the highest ranking member they had available to assign to Cur'Estan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaxan is good-hearted, and while he is not a skilled cleric, he is a skilled administrator, and the camp he runs hums along with minimal friction.  He is regularly at odds with Wyrmling, who hates giving valuable supplies to the refugees, even though General Heartbren ordered that all necessary supplies be made available.
    </p>    
  </div>
  <div id="curestanlocations">
    <h3>Locations in Cur'Estan</h3>
    <h4>The Castle</h4>
    <p>
      The Castle of Cur'Estan is a massive fortress recently restored after being abandoned for some 500 years.  The castle towers each have basement storerooms, several floors of sleeping and living quarters for soldiers, and watch rooms.  When rebuilding the castle, the irregulars built a plumbing system into the keep, making use of a dwarven pump well to pull water from the local acquifer and move it to the various areas of the keep and walls.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Keep
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Keep of Cur'Estan is used to house additional soldiers, the leadership of the Black Wolf Irregulars, and entertain guests and visitors.  Beuracratic staff and major officers have offices and living quarters in the higher floors.  The ground floor is dominated by the Great Hall and the armory, while the kitchens, pump system, and store rooms dominate the basement.  Gerad Heartbren has his office on the 4th floor of the keep, surrounded by abandoned offices once belonging to the other generals of the Black Wolf Irregulars.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Quartermaster's Warehouse
    </h4>
    <p>
      The quartermaster's central warehouse is the receiving point for goods in the keep.  While technically in charge of all of the castle's stores, the quartermaster keeps the most valuable goods close at hand in his central warehouse on the west wall of the keep.  The small quartermaster's gate behind the warehouse allows for quickly unloading wagons into the central warehouse, from which goods are then distributed to the other storerooms and assigned to soldiers or staff who need them.  Wyrmling Trapsmith spends most of his time in this central warehouse.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Stables and Blacksmith
    </h4>
    <p>
      The north wall of the castle is dominated by the Stables and blacksmiths shop.  Once containing enough horse for a sizable contingent of cavalry, the stables are barely at half capacity today.  The blacksmith here mostly handles tools, horseshoes, and repairs.  There is also a cooper and wheelright who work out of the blacksmith shop.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Bladesmith, Fletcher, and Armorer
    </h4>
    <p>
      Weapons and armor are made and repaired on site by the specialists working in the southeast corner of the keep.  All goods orders for the armorer, bladesmith, and fletcher come through the quartermaster, and finished goods are sent to the quartermasters warehouse for storage.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Town
    </h4>
    <p>
      The town itself is dominated by the embassies, 6 large stone buildings near the center of town.  The only other stone building in the town is Margo's Mystics.  The town is fairly wealthy, dominated by merchants who handle supply chains for the irregulars and lords of the rising dawn, and the families of officers and soldiers.  
    </p>
    <h4>Market Square</h4>
    <p>
      The open space between the keep and the embassies is dominated each morning by market stalls, stands, and carts.  Here you can find all sorts of goods for sale, from meat pies to cleavers.  The market opens at dawn each day, and most merchants have closed up shop by noon. There are very few open shops with permanent buildings in the town, as the residents have become accustomed to the morning market tradition, saving their shopping for the next morning.
    </p>
    <h4>Kandori Embassy</h4>
    <p>
      The Kandori Embassy building is the largest and closest to the castle.  Here James Lightbringer, Ambassador of the King of Kandor and General of the Lords of the Rising Dawn, keeps his offices and beauracratic staff.  The embassy is in near constant contact with the castle, as the two forces work to coordinate their efforts and supply chains.
    </p>
    <h4>Gerasaline Embassy</h4>
    <p>
      Just north of the Kandori embassy, the Gerasaline embassy sits largely empty.  A skeleton staff keeps it clean and in-shape, while the ambassador in charge, Therin Lightsword, has not heard from his queen since the fall of Strovenguard.  The embassy ran out of funds some time ago, and the staff are now paid directly by the Black Wolf Irregulars.
    </p>
    <h4>Dormanian Embassy</h4>
    <p>
      The Dormanian Embassy has been run by a skeleton crew lately, as Dormania has dealt with it's own internal issues.  Since the resolution of the Imperial Succession there have been rumors of a new delegation to arrive soon.
    </p>
    <h4>Old Curinor Embassy</h4>
    <p>
      The Curinor embassy is all but abandoned.  Officially Curinor has withdrawn all support for outside forces, including the irregulars, to focus on the defense of their own lands and holds.
    </p>
    <h4>Eldoranian Embassy</h4>
    <p>
      A few months ago the Ambassador from Eldoran, a minor prince and cousin to the King, died suddenly in his sleep.  The chaos in civil war in Eldoran since then has meant no replacement has arrived.
    </p>
    <h4>Thorian Embassy</h4>
    <p>
      Demal Thor's ambassador still resides in the embassy, though there has been no council of clan chiefs in some time and thus no orders for him.  He has dismissed all of his staff so that they can return to their families if they live and help them make it out of Demal Thor to the relative safety of the refugee camps.
    </p>
    <h4>Margo's Mystics</h4>
    <p>
      Margo is an excentric gnome of unparalelled magical skill who specializes in enchantments.  Roughly 2 months ago she showed up in town, purchased the house of the richest merchant in town for an exorbitant sum, and then proceeded to turn the wooden walls into stone with magic.  She has a small store front on the first floor where she offers magical goods, although nothing besides pictures and descriptions are ever on display.  Whenever someone makes an order she disappears into a backroom, and 5 minutes later comes out with the desired item.  Her list of items in stock changes erratically and at odd intervals, things disappearing from her 'in stock' list without anyone ever coming to buy them.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious (and not so obvious) magical traps block the entrance into any part of the house outside of the main storefront.  To date Margo has apprehended 15 thieve's attempting to sneak into her store room.  No one is known to have ever succeeded at stealing anything of value from inside Margo's home.
    </p>
    <h4>Kyman's House</h4>
    <p>
      Kyman Hexhammer owns a large house near the Eldoranian Embassy, from which a variety of shady characters regularly come and go.  Although none of them seem to stay in town long. From here he runs a contract spy and infiltration service for the Black Wolf Irregulars, collects the information they bring in, and sends on the reports to General Heartbren.  The house and its furnishings display an ostentatious display of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyman himself doesn't live in the house, but a mysterious door in the back goes to his personal Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion, where he himself lives.
    </p>
    <h4>Refugee Camp</h4>
    <p>
      In recent months refugees from Gerasalim and Demal Thor have been arriving in Kandor by the thousands.  Gerad offered the area south of the city to Amathera's Shield for a refugee camp.  It currently houses about 1000 people, mostly from southwestern Gerasalim.  The camp is run by a cleric of Amathera by the name of Jaxan Chin.  The camp is an orderly place, with large tents full of straight rows of cots.  The camp is largely run by volunteers from within the refugee population itself.  The camp is (for the most part) supplied by the Black Wolf Irregulars, although Wyrmling is regularly stingy with supplies for the refugees, Jaxan has secured additional supplies directly through Amathera's Shield such that no one in the camp goes hungry.
    </p>
    <h4>Southern Barracks</h4>
    <p>
      The Southern Barracks is overflow housing for the Black Wolf Irregulars soldiers.  Currently at about half capacity, it consists of 6 large multilevel stone buildings each with beds, kitchens, and even plumbing.
    </p>    
  </div>
  <div id="curestanfactions">
    <h3>Factions in Cur'Estan</h3>
    <h4>Amathera's Shield</h4>
    <p>
      Amathera's Shield runs the refugee camp in town, and is lead by Jaxan Shield.  There are only a few actual members of Amathera's Shield in town, as most of their numbers are dedicated to camps that need more active protection (and don't sit in the shadow of a friendly fortress with a sizable army).  Jaxan is not particularly comfortable dealing with things outside of his mission to help the destitute.
    </p>
    <h4>Artificer's of Mechanus</h4>
    <p>
      The Artificer's don't have an official representative in town, but Margo is in fact a member of the group, and is in regular contact with the guild leadership in Stagenheim.
    </p>
    <h4>Black Sun</h4>
    <p>
      Kyman Hexhammer has coopted by right of rank the small Black Sun presence that had been in Cur'Estan, and largely turned it towards the war effort.  The previous local guild master's disappearance remains an unsolved crime in town (one that the General Heartbren has informed the local constabulary they can safely ignore for the time being).
    </p>
    <h4>Black Wolf Irregulars</h4>
    <p>
      The Black Wolf Irregulars are the preeminent power in town.  They own the 3 mile radius around the castle as sovereign territory by treaty with the King of Kandor.  As such Gerad Heartbren, as the last ranking general of the Black Wolves, acts as the local ruler of the town.
    </p>
    <h4>Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans</h4>
    <p>
      Most of the merchants in town are members of the Illustrious Guild of Merchants.  They don't have a local leader, but have regular meetings at various bars in town to discuss issues and current events.
    </p>
    <h4>International Grangemaster's Alliance</h4>
    <p>
      The Grangemaster's Alliance has a chapter house in town where farmers from around the area meet to discuss problems and politics.
    </p>
    <h4>Lords of the Rising Dawn</h4>
    <p>
      The Lords of the Rising Dawn have a sizable presence in town, led by Duke Lightbringer.  They have a barracks compound on the southeast edge of town.
    </p>
    <h4>Maker's of Legend</h4>
    <p>
      The Maker's of Legend have inserted themselves into the Black Wolf Irregulars.  The local group is led by Haera Oelefros, and they are determined to record the events of the Orc War from the front lines.  Haera has an office in the keep, and has been tasked by General Heartbren with general records keeping and interfacing with foreign dignitaries.
    </p>
    <h4>Trollkin Mercenary Corps</h4>
    <p>
      There is currently a small embedded unit of the Trollkin Mercenary Corps with the Black Wolf Irregulars.
    </p>
