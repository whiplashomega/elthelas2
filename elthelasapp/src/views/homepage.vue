      Welcome to Elthelas. Elthelas is a world of fantasy. It is full of strange creatures, wondrous places, dark evils, and grand adventures. In Elthelas Gods and magic are a part of day to day life.

    <h2>Current Plans</h2>
    <p>
      The website is currently in a state of flux. Following the OGL drama of early 2023, I decided to do a personal fork of the ruleset. Bringing in some of the ideas seen in the OneDND playtest, some pulled from other systems entirely, plus additional ideas of my own and those of my friends to rework the rules, classes, ancestries, backgrounds, armor, weapons, and more. The current state of these changes can be seen here, but are subject to change at any time based on our playtesting, or as we find and want to integrate other ideas. The end goal is to create a system that is enough like 5e that a 5e player can pretty seamlessly step into the new system, while providing a more robust ruleset that provides greater challenge to the players, and without sacrificing core concepts such as bounded accuracy, randomness, rules-based tactical combat, and role play. To browse these rules, you can find information under the 'Character' and 'Reference' menus. While rules-agnostic information about the setting itself can be found in the 'World' menu. For archived reference materials related specifically to 5e, see the 5e menu.

    <h2>Overview of Elthelas</h2>
    <p>
      Compared to your average D&D setting, Elthelas is more civilized.  The world sits in a place like 14th-15th century Europe. While guns have yet to make their debut, gunpowder is in use by select groups. Nationalism is taking root.  Kings are able to enforce their will beyond the city or castle gates. Even the 'evil' races have started to settle down. The orcs have large cities and settlements that are part of a large decentralized empire. The civilized races have pushed the remaining races to the wild places on the edges of the world.  Gnolls, bugbears, and centaurs all fit into this category. For those who were not pushed, the civilized races subjugated them instead. Goblins, hobgoblins, and kobolds fit into this category.
    </p>
    <p>
      An increase in organized society also means that war is no longer an idle pastime for local lords.  Wars are now often massive decade spanning conflicts between alliances of kingdoms. In these wars thousands if not millions of lives hang in the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This more 'civilized' world also brings danger for would-be adventurers. Kings and rulers are less likely to appreciate those who skirt the edges of the law for the greater good. Many of the civilized nations have regulated the use of magic. The morally-gray schools such as enchantment in particular is heavy regulated. Even so, many rulers owe their thrones to alliances with the colleges of magic.  Magic can bring a significant martial advantage in battle. Rulers draw the ire of the colleges at great risk. A college backing a rebellion or pretender can mean the end of a dynasty. The high priests likewise For most the Gods are a proven fact, and their withdrawal a selfless act to save the world. The common folk see the high priests of their faiths as the voice of their chosen God, disobeyed at risk of both immediate mortal and eternal peril.

    <h2>Origins of the Setting</h2>
    <p>
      The world of Elthelas was first conceived sometime around 1998. The game Baldur's Gate had just come out. Baldur's Gate introduced me and many of my friends to the world of Dungeons and Dragons for the first time. Role playing was a new and interesting concept. We didn't have access to source materials or rules so we had to create our own. The original game we played was a loose LARP with few rules, but then again, we were in 7th grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a couple of years we all moved on with our lives and stopped playing the game, but the world lived on in my head. In high school I wrote a short story and then a (bad) novel taking place in the setting.  The main characters of the book were the ones my friends and I had conceived of back in middle school. The original materials will likely never see the light of day.  Even so, I believe I still have the manuscript somewhere on my hard drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I undertook to rework the source material in college. I also started a rewrite of the book.  I hoped to use my somewhat increased experience both in the genre and in writing to improve the work. The source material took a decent shape from this effort, but the rewrite never got past chapter 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a couple years after college that I played my first game of actual Dungeons and Dragons. It was only a matter of time until I reworked the source material back into the format that had inspired it: a Dungeons and Dragons campaign setting. So far I have run 5 successful campaigns in the setting, and am nearly finished running campaign number 6. The first of those campaigns used D&D 3.5 rules, otherwise, so far they have all used D&D 5e. Those campaigns are as follows:
    </p>
    <h2>Previous Campaigns</h2>
    <h4>Epic of Elthelas: Book 1, the Rise of ME</h4>
    <p>
      This campaign followed a group of misfits recruited to defend the Fortress of Light, who quickly found themselves outcast and enmeshed in the schemes of a sentient plane that simply referred to itself as "ME". This entity sought to eliminate the goddess Gaian. The players eventually defeated the Avatar of this planar entity on the northern plains of Zelfir, at least temporarily halting their plans. Other shenanigans also ensued, such as the openning of a portal to the Abyss in the middle of the city of Marinda.
    </p>
    <h4>Epic of Elthelas: Book 2, Gods and Demons</h4>
    <p>
      This campaign occurs about 6 months after the events of the first campaign, but now following a different group of adventurers responding to a flier from a tiny town in Gerasalim asking for help. These adventurers helped the town with its troubles, only to find themselves on the trail of a half-elf named Galen (one of the characters from the first campaign), who is acting erratically. Over the course of the campaign they learn that there are several Arcanum crystals that seal away the being known as "ME" from affecting the world directly. Those in possession of the crystals leave themselves susceptible to possession by "ME". In tracking Galen and the crystals, they manage to seal the portal to the abyss openned in Book 1, but are unable to prevent the destruction of the crystals. On the crystals destruction it is discovered that "ME" is in fact the Goddess Area having had her consciousness stripped from her in ancient days by the other Gods, and confined to her home plane. Awakened and freed on the mortal plane, Area immediately seeks vengeance on her sisters, Nera and Gaian. The party intercepts Area at the palace of Nera, hitting her with Nera's god killing dagger, stripping her once again of her ability to affect planes outside her own. The massive release of divine energy at this event turns most of the party members present into celestials.
    </p>
    <h4>Epic of Elthelas: Book 3, The Succession Crisis</h4>
    <p>
      This campaign takes a very different perspective than the last two. Rather than being a world spanning adventure, it focused in on Dormania, and specifically in resolving the brewing succession crisis happening there at the time. Again occurring a few months after the end of Book 2, the party members are hirelings of Baroness Ransomir, a well meaning lord of a small town with a minor claim to the throne. The party works first to secure the Baroness position against rival lords, before embarking on a quest to convince the great dukes of the realm to back the now Countess Ransomir as the new Empress of Dormania. The campaign finishes with a grand battle between the remaining two claimants outside the capitol, the opposing claimant, a powerful warlock, assisted by the forces of Hell itself.
    </p>
    <h4>Epic of Elthelas: Book 4, The Orc War</h4>
    <p>
      Book 4 was actually attempted twice, neither one ever reaching the conclusion, with the first attempt fizzling after a couple months, and the second lasting until it was rudely ended by the Covid pandemic. This campaign followed a group of adventurers recruited by the Black Wolf Irregulars to help turn the tide of the Orc War, which by this point has laid waste to the nations of Demal Thor and Gerasalim, and the armies of the Alliance having repeatedly failed to stop the Prince of Fiends relentless advance. Through intrigue and infiltration, the party is able to bring the Dwarves back into the alliance, save refugees from Gerasalim, eliminate rebel groups distracting the Empress of Dormania, and effect a successful defense of Cur'Estan. The final part of the campaign, which the players were never able to complete, would have had them strike deep into orcish territory to raise a rebellion against the Prince of Fiends, before moving against the Prince himself in his lair.
    </p>
    <h4>Down the River</h4>
    <p>
      This side campaign, run entirely online during the pandemic, followed a group of merchant guards as they inadvertantly uncover a scheme by a group of vampires and necromancers to wipe out the populace using a plague and blot out the sun over Alfadir, creating a haven for the undead. Taking place some two years after the events of Book 4.
    </p>
    <h4>Epic of Elthelas: Book 5 - The New Order</h4>
    <p>
      The next full length campaign has followed the siblings Dardanus, children of a minor baron of the new Federated Alliance Territories, essentially the occupied zones of orcish territory. The family must cope with their dying father, as well as the growing undead threat of the once great evoker turned Lich, Ching Shu. After finally defeating Ching Shu and bringing a tentative peace to the F.A.T., they embark on a quest to save their fathers soul from Skotevas, home of the dark God of the Orcs, Mat'raktha.
