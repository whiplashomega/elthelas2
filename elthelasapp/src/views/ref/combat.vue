        <h2>Actions in Combat</h2>
        <p>
          When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
        </p>
        <h4>Attack</h4>
        <p>
          The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.
        </p>
        <h4>Cast a Spell</h4>
        <p>
          Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.
        </p>
        <h4>Dash</h4>
        <p>
          When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.
        </p>
        <h4>Delay</h4>
        <p>
          If you do not wish to take your turn immediately you can take a free action called delay. Instead, you’re removed from the initiative order. You can return to the initiative order as a free action triggered by the end of any other creature’s turn. This permanently changes your initiative to the new position. You can’t use reactions until you return to the initiative order. If you Delay an entire round without returning to the initiative order, the actions from the Delayed turn are lost, your initiative doesn’t change, and your next turn occurs at your original position in the initiative order.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you Delay, any persistent damage or other negative effects that normally occur at the start or end of your turn occur immediately when you use the Delay action. Any beneficial effects that would end at any point during your turn also end. The GM might determine that other effects end when you Delay as well. Essentially, you can’t Delay to avoid negative consequences that would happen on your turn or to extend beneficial effects that would end on your turn.
        </p>
        <h4>Disengage</h4>
        <p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>
        <h4>Dodge</h4>
        <p>
          When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.
        </p>
        <h4>Help</h4>
        <p>
          You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.
        </p>
        <h4>Hide</h4>
        <p>
          When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter.
        </p>
        <h4>Ready</h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."
        </p>
        <p>
          When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.
        </p>
        <h4>Search</h4>
        <p>
          When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
        </p>
        <h4>Use an Object</h4>
        <p>
          You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="1" title="Cover">
        <h2>Cover</h2>
        <p>
          Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="2" title="Damage and Healing">
        <h2>Damage and Healing</h2>
        <p>
          Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.
        </p>
        <h4>Hit Points</h4>
        <p>
          Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.
        </p>
        <h4>Damage Rolls</h4>
        <p>
          Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used for the attack roll--to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.
        </p>
        <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
        <p>
          When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
        </p>
        <h4>Damage Types</h4>
        <p>
          Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.
        </p>
        <p>
          The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.
        </p>
        <table class="table table-sm">
          <thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Examples</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Acid</td><td>The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bludgeoning</td><td>Blunt force attacks--hammers, falling, constriction, and the like--deal bludgeoning damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Cold</td><td>The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fire</td><td>Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Force</td><td>Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Lightning</td><td>A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Necrotic</td><td>Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Piercing</td><td>Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Poison</td><td>Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Psychic</td><td>Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Radiant</td><td>Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Slashing</td><td>Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Thunder</td><td>A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h4>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h4>
        <p>
          Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
        </p>
        <h4>Healing</h4>
        <p>
          Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.
        </p>
        <h4>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h4>
        <p>
          When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h5>Instant Death</h5>
        <p>
          Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.
        </p>
        <h5>Falling Unconscious</h5>
        <p>
          If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.
        </p>
        <h5>Death Saving Throws</h5>
        <p>
          Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
        </p>
        <h5>Stabilizing a Creature</h5>
        <p>
          The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
        </p>
        <h5>Monsters and Death</h5>
        <p>
          Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.
        </p>
        <h4>Knocking a Creature Out</h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
        </p>
        <h4>Temporary Hit Points</h4>
        <p>
          Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="3" title="Making an Attack">
        <h2>Making an Attack</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose a target.</strong> Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>
          <li><strong>Determine modifiers.</strong> The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>
          <li><strong>Resolve the attack.</strong> You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.</p>
        <h4>Attack Rolls</h4>
        <p>
          When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.
        </p>
        <h5>Modifiers to the Roll</h5>
        <p>
          When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ability Modifier.</strong> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.
        </p>
        <h5>Rolling 1 or 20</h5>
        <p>
          Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.
        </p>
        <h4>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h4>
        <p>
          Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden--both unseen and unheard--when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.
        </p>
        <h4>Ranged Attacks</h4>
        <p>
          When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.
        </p>
        <h5>Range</h5>
        <p>
          You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.
        </p>
        <h5>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h5>
        <p>
          Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.
        </p>
        <h4>Melee Attacks</h4>
        <p>
          Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.
        </p>
        <h5>Opportunity Attacks</h5>
        <p>
          In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
        </p>
        <h5>Two-Weapon Fighting</h5>
        <p>
          When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can make one extra attack as part of the same Action. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon in the other hand, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attacks damage. You can make this extra attack only once on each of your turns.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you take the attack action on your turn and have a shortsword in one hand and a dagger in the other-each of which has the light property-you can make one attack with each weapon, but you don't add your strength or dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the second weapon.
        </p>
        <h4>Contests in Combat</h4>
        <p>
          Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.
        </p>
        <h5>Grappling</h5>
        <p>
          When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Escaping a Grapple.</strong> A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Moving a Grappled Creature.</strong> When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
        </p>
        <h5>Shoving a Creature</h5>
        <p>
          Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="4" title="Mounted Combat">
        <h2>Mounted Combat</h2>
        <p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p>
        <p>
          A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
        </p>
        <h4>Mounting and Dismounting</h4>
        <p>
          Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
        </p>
        <h4>Controlling a Mount</h4>
        <p>
          While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.
        </p>
        <p>
          An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="5" title="Movement and Positioning">
        <h2>Movement and Positioning</h2>
        <p>
          In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.
        </p>
        <h4>Breaking Up Your Move</h4>
        <p>
          You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.
        </p>
        <h5>Moving Between Attacks</h5>
        <p>
          If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.
        </p>
        <h5>Using Different Speeds</h5>
        <p>
          If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.
        </p>
        <h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
        <p>
          Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
        </p>
        <h4>Being Prone</h4>
        <p>
          Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
        </p>
        <h5>Interacting with Objects</h5>
        <p>
          You can interact with one object as part of your turn without expending your movement or action. If you want to interact with an additional object you must use your action to do so.
        </p>
        <h4>Moving Around Other Creatures</h4>
        <p>
          You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.
        </p>
        <h4>Flying Movement</h4>
        <p>
          Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
        </p>
        <h4>Creature Size</h4>
        <p>
          Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.
        </p>
        <table class="table table-sm">
          <thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Space</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2 1/2 x 2 1/2 ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Small</td><td>5 x 5 ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 x 5 ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Large</td><td>10 x 10 ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Huge</td><td>15 x 15 ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>20 x 20 ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Colossal</td><td>25 x 25 ft. (or more)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h5>Space</h5>
        <p>
          A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‐foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
        </p>
        <h5>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h5>
        <p>
          A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="6" title="The Order of Combat">
        <h2>The Order of Combat</h2>
        <p>
          A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
        </p>
        <h5>Combat Step by Step</h5>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>
          <li><strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are--how far away and in what direction.</li>
          <li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.</li>
          <li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>
          <li><strong>Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Surprise</h4>
        <p>
          A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.
        </p>
        <h4>Initiative</h4>
        <p>
          Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.
        </p>
        <h4>Your Turn</h4>
        <p>
          On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed--sometimes called your walking speed--is noted on your character sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common actions you can take are described in the "Actions in Combat" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Movement and Position" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in "Actions in Combat."
        </p>
        <h5>Bonus Actions</h5>
        <p>
          Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.
        </p>
        <p>
          You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
        </p>
        <h5>Other Activity on Your Turn</h5>
        <p>
          Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
        </p>
        <h4>Reactions</h4>
        <p>
          Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.
        </p>
      </b-tab>
      <b-tab index="7" title="Underwater Combat">
        <h2>Underwater Combat</h2>
        <p>
          When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon does piercing damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).
        </p>
        <p>
          Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

      <b-tab index="8" title="Conditions">
        <h3>Conditions</h3>
        <h4>Exhaustion</h4>
        <p>While you are subjected to the Exhausted Condition you experience the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Levels of Exhaustion.</strong> This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds half of your constitution score (rounded up, minimum 2).</li>
          <li><strong>d20 Rolls Affected.</strong> When you make a d20 test (such as an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check), you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.</li>
          <li><strong>Spell Save DCs Affected.</strong> Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast, as well as the save DC for any class or racial abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Ending the Condition.</strong> Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer exhausted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Blinded</h4>

        <h3>Injuries</h3>

          <b-tab title="Rules">
            <p>
              The following homebrew injury rules come via rypillal, with some minor changes for brevity and formatting. <a href="http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rypillall">See his original at Homebrewery</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the character is at 0 hit points or less, the character is injured, and the player rolls a d100 on the relevant Lingering Injuries table, adding the character's Constitution score to the roll. If the attack does enough damage that the leftover damage is equal to half or more of their maximum hit points, the character is severely injured, and the player doesn't add the character's Constitution score to the roll.
            </p>
            <p>
              Results should be written onto the character's sheet as a new flaw. Also, unless the result is "I'm... I'm Alright!", the character must still make death saving throws as usual. If a result doesn't specify any lasting injury to the character, assume that, in the long-term, they recover with no adverse lingering effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which Lingering Injuries table they roll on depends on the damage type of the attack that pushed the character to the 0 hit points threshold. If the injuring attack combined two or more damage types (such as slashing and fire damage), either go with the damage table that makes most sense, or roll once and cross reference the result on both (or all) tables, and go with what is most fun or interesting: the Dungeon Master has the final say. Should the character be resistant to the injuring attack's damage type, they gain advantage on the roll.
            </p>
            <h4>Recovery</h4>
            <p>
              Several of the Lingering Injury results give a base recovery time, often expressed in increments of days or weeks, after which the worst effects of an injury diminish. However, as different individuals recover at different rates, the base recovery times given in the various entries should be modified by deducting the character's Constitution score.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as the character's general vigour, factors such as lifestyle can have an impact on how quickly a character can recuperate during downtime. Particularly bad living conditions can drag a recovery out for longer, whereas good food and surroundings can have a character up on their feet in no time!
            </p>
            <p>
              Consult the list below and, depending on the recovering character's lifestyle, apply a positive or negative adjustment to the character's effective Constitution score for recovery purposes. If a character undergoes a variety of lifestyles while recuperating, average out the modifier according to logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the character can choose to focus on recuperating during their downtime. Each whole day of recuperating activity counts as two days of base recovery time.

              <tbody>
                <tr><td>1</td><th>Instant Death.</th><td>Your brain or other major organs are dissolved, killing you instantly.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><th>Fatal Wound</th><td>Either you suffer massive tissue damage, or major organs are part eaten away. Even if you succeed at the normal death saving throws, you remain unconscious and will die after 1d6 turns have passed, at the end of your turn, unless you are magically healed above 0 hit points, or stabilised with a DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check using a healer's kit. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><th>Paralysis</th><td>Spinal damage leaves you unable to move or feel anything from the waist down. You will need carrying or some sort of device to allow mobility (otherwise you can only crawl 5 feet per turn), and count as restrained. Still, there is always hope for a particularly strong person: at the beginning of every week, you can make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw – on a success, you miraculously recover. Otherwise, this flaw only ends if you receive powerful magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><th>Melted Arm</th><td>Your arm or hand is scorched off, pumping arterial blood and yellow ichor everywhere. Due to the flow of blood, you lose 1d6 hit points at the end of each of your turns, unless you receive magical healing to seal the stump, it is cauterised by fire or radiant damage, or another character uses an action to apply a tourniquet. Due to system shock, you must make a death saving throw immediately, with disadvantage on the roll. Following recovery, you can no longer hold anything with two hands, and can hold only a single object at a time. The distraction of the pain means that if you attempt to cast any spell you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. Finally, if the lost arm was your dominant arm (50% chance), unless you are trained in the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you suffer disadvantage with weapon attacks until you learn to use your off-hand. You learn to live with this pain and train your off-hand after a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). The limb can be restored by either Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><th>Melted Leg</th><td>Your leg or foot is scorched off, pumping arterial blood and yellow ichor everywhere. Due to the flow of blood, you lose 1d6 hit points at the end of each of your turns, unless you receive magical healing to seal the stump, it is cauterised by fire or radiant damage, or another character uses an action to apply a tourniquet. Due to system shock, you must make a death saving throw immediately, with disadvantage on the roll. Following recovery, your speed on foot is halved and you must use a cane or crutch to move, unless you receive a prosthesis of some kind. Additionally, you fall prone after using the dash action, and suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Finally, distraction from the pain means that if you attempt to cast any spell you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. You learn to live with this pain after a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). The limb can be restored by either Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6-8</td><th>Multiple Injuries</th><td>Roll again on this table 1d3+1 times, suffering the combined effects of the various results (within reason!). Reroll any duplicates, and also reroll Multiple Injuries, Full Recovery, “I'm... I'm Alright!” and any results which indicate death (like Fatal Wound or Instant Death). You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>9-10</td><th>Internal Bleeding</th><td>The attack leaves you with hidden damage, drawing you towards death. You lose 1d3 hit points at the end of every hour, even if stabilised. This injury is difficult to spot, but once diagnosed, This flaw can be removed by magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, or if another character proficient in Medicine conducts surgery: this takes 1 hour, expends one use of a healer's kit and requires a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The surgery itself inflicts 3d6 piercing damage. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>11-12</td><th>Frail</th><td>You recover, but your health is never quite the same again. You can barely keep food down, and lose 1 point from your Constitution score. Finally, if you suffer this flaw again in the future, your hit dice are permanently reduced by one: if multiple versions of this flaw reduce the character's hit dice to 0, you die. This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13-14</td><th>Painful Joints</th><td>You heal, but are never again as sprightly. You lose 1 point from your Dexterity score. If you suffer this flaw again in the future, your hit dice are permanently reduced by one: if multiple versions of this flaw reduce your hit dice to 0, you die. This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>15-16</td><th>Enfeebled</th><td>You heal, but are never again as strong. You lose 1 point from your Strength score. If you suffer this flaw again in the future, your hit dice are permanently reduced by one: if multiple versions of this flaw reduce your hit dice to 0, you die. This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>17-18</td><th>Ruined Eye</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), one of your eyes is destroyed. From now on, you suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and on ranged attack rolls. If a subsequent injury damages your other eye, you are permanently blinded. Magic such as Regenerate or Wish can restore the lost eye. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>19-20</td><th>Pelvic Injury</th><td>The attack destroys your nethers. Whenever you attempt a Strength (Athletics) check or take any action in combat (other than casting a spell), you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose 1d6 hit points. You also can't ride a horse without suffering 1d10 hit points. Finally, this injury renders you permanently infertile. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 70 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, although the infertility can only be reversed by Greater Restoration or Remove Curse. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>21-23</td><th>Leg Wound</th><td>Your leg is badly damaged. Until a base recovery time of 40 days has passed (see Recovery above), you must use a cane or crutch to move at half speed, you fall prone after using the dash action, and you suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Even after the worst of the damage has passed, your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. The limb can be restored by either Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>24-25</td><th>Hand Injury</th><td>The attack costs you several fingers. There is a 50% chance of the affected hand being your dominant hand. You can just about carry a shield, but if it's a weapon hand, your weapon attacks suffer a -2 penalty, unless you are trained in either the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style. Also, if it is your dominant hand, if you attempt to cast a spell with somatic components, you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. These penalties last a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). This flaw can be reversed by magic such as Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>26-28</td><th>Ruined Armor</th><td>Unless your armour is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it badly damaged, affording little protection and fitting badly. You suffer -2 from your AC. This penalty lasts until it is replaced, repaired or subject to a Mending spell. If you have no armour, treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>29-30</td><th>Old Battle Wound</th><td>You more or less recover, but become plagued for years with recurring pains. After every long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer -2 to your Dexterity and Wisdom scores until the next long rest. This penalty can be neutralised by special salves, prepared by a character proficient in Medicine or using a herbalism kit with which they are proficient. This flaw can be removed through magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>31-32</td><td>Useless Shield</td><td>Unless your shield is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it ruined and worthless. It provides no bonus to AC until it is repaired or subjected to a mending spell. If you don't have a shield, treat this result as Ruined Armour. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>33-36</td><th>Infected Wounds</th><td>The damage refuses to properly heal, and instead becomes swollen and leaks a noisome pus. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 for every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive the spell heal minor injury or, alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. Characters who are immune to disease treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>37-38</td><th>Personality Change</th><td>In the aftermath of the attack, due to post-traumatic stress, you soon exhibit a shift in personality. Roll 1d100 and consult the Indefinite Madness table (on page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to see what permanent flaw you gain. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish, or possibly by some kind of long-term therapy, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>39-40</td><th>I'm Melting!</th><td>Unless you are immune to being frightened, you frantically stumble towards an ally, grasping at them, pleading for help and dripping acid, before passing out. You immediately move up to half your speed (rounded up) towards a random friendly creature and attempt a grapple; this movement can result in opportunity attacks. If the grapple succeeds, you also inflict 1d6 acid damage. At the beginning of your next turn, you fall unconscious, and begin making death saving throws as usual. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>41-42</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards dragons or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of acid). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Greater restoration or Wish.  You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>43-46</td><th>Horrible Scar</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), you are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed, or palated. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magic like Heal, Regenerate or Wish can remove the scar. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>47-96</td><th>Exhausted</th><td>It will take time to fully recover from your wounds and you are exhausted. Gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Scarred Nerves</th><td>Bathed in a mist of acid droplets, the pain is so intense it proves transcendental, ruining almost all your nerve endings. Although horrific, you learn to live with the background pain, and future sensations seem trivial. Following a long rest, you feel almost no pain, and can reroll a failed Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on spells due to receiving damage; you must accept the second result. Also, in future, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. Finally, as you may find it difficult to perceive the extent of your injuries, the Dungeon Master might like to roll for your future Lingering Injuries in secret! This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Regenerate or Wish.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>99+</td><th>I'm... I'm Alright!</th><td>The gods must be smiling today – the blow seemed worse than it actually is, and you are assumed dead. Rather than making any death saving throws, you are instead stabilised and returned to 1 hit point and, at the beginning of your next turn, regain 1d10 hit points and can act as normal, gaining advantage on your first attack that turn.</td></tr>

Following recovery, your speed on foot is halved and you must use a cane or crutch to move, unless you receive a prosthesis of some kind. Additionally, you fall prone after using the dash action, and suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Finally, the distraction of the pain means that if you attempt to cast any spell you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. You learn to live with this pain after a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). The limb can be restored by either Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

You can do little more than speak, but can still cast spells that don't require somatic components. However, as you can't feel much of your body, you gain advantage on any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on spells due to receiving damage. After every long rest, the character can make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to end the paralysis. This flaw can also be removed by magic such as Freedom of Movement, Greater Restoration, Heal Minor Injury, Remove Curse or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

You lose 1d3 hit points at the end of every hour, even if stabilised. This injury is difficult to spot, but once diagnosed, This flaw can be removed by magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, or if another character proficient in Medicine conducts surgery: this takes 1 hour, expends one use of a healer's kit and requires a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The surgery itself inflicts 3d6 piercing damage. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13-14</td><th>Frail</th><td>You recover, but your health is never quite the same again. You can barely keep food down, and lose 1 point from your Constitution score. Finally, if you suffer this flaw again in the future, your hit dice are permanently reduced by one: if multiple versions of this flaw reduce the character's hit dice to 0, you die.

                <tr><td>19-20</td><th>Head Injury</th><td> If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), then head trauma damages your mental facilities somehow, often leaving a bald patch at the scar. Roll 1d3: 1: you lose 1 point from your Intelligence score; 2: you lose 1 point from your Wisdom score; 3: you lose 1 point from your Charisma score. This flaw is often accompanied by speech or memory problems, requiring you to relearn basic skills and social niceties. If the same ability score is affected a second time or more in the future by this flaw, you must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or also suffer the Coma flaw (see the Cold Damage page). This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>21-22</td><th>Multiple Fractures</th><td>You take a thorough beating, punctuated by the cracking of several bones.

You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>23-24</td><th>Broken Jaw</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 11 Dexterity or Constitution saving throw (your choice) – if you fail (or have no helmet), your jaw is smashed, scattering teeth everwhere. You find eating and speaking very painful, and suffer disadvantage on most Charisma checks. Additionally, if you attempt to cast a spell which uses verbal components, you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 90 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>25-26</td><th>Broken Arm</th><td>As the attack slams home, an audible 'crack' renders an arm close to useless for a time. There is a 50% chance that the broken arm is your dominant arm and if so, unless you are trained in the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you suffer disadvantage with weapon attacks. If it is your other arm, you cannot wear a shield. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 30 weeks (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as a Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>27-28</td><th>Deafened</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), then either through brain damage or damage to the ears, you are deafened.

You also can't ride a horse without suffering 1d10 hit points. Finally, this injury renders you permanently infertile. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 70 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, although the infertility can only be reversed by Greater Restoration or Remove Curse. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>31-32</td><th>Leg Wound</th><td>Your leg is badly damaged. Until a base recovery time of 40 days has passed (see Recovery above), you must use a cane or crutch to move at half speed, you fall prone after using the dash action, and you suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Even after the worst of the damage has passed, your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. The limb can be restored by magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>33-34</td><th>Broken Ribs</th><td>Your rib cage is partly caved in. Whenever you attempt a Strength (Athletics) check or attempt to take any action in combat (other than casting a spell), you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If you fail the save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 50 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>35-36</td><th>Punch Drunk</th><td> If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), then due to hearing impairment or brain trauma, your coordination is often disrupted. After every short or long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (your choice), or suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. This penalty lasts until the next short or long rest. Additionally, if you are knocked prone, it costs you double the standard movement to stand up. This flaw can be removed through magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Heal Minor Injury, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>37-38</td><th>Ruined Armor</th><td>Unless your armour is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it badly damaged, affording little protection and fitting badly. You suffer -2 from your AC. This penalty lasts until it is replaced, repaired or subject to a Mending spell. If you have no armour, treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>39-40</td><td>Useless Shield</td><td>Unless your shield is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it ruined and worthless.

                <tr><td>41-42</td><th>Personality Change</th><td>In the aftermath of the attack, either as a result of head injury or due to post-traumatic stress, you soon exhibit a shift in personality. Roll 1d100 and consult the Indefinite Madness table (on page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to see what permanent flaw you gain. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish, or possibly by some kind of long-term therapy, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>43</td><th>Fastball Special</th><td>The force of the attack sends you haplessly flying through the air towards another unsuspecting creature. You are pushed up to 10 feet towards a random creature and, if in range to strike it, knock it prone, unless that other creature succeeds at a DC 11 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (creature's choice). This roll is made with disadvantage if you are bigger than the dodging creature. If you are huge or gargantuan, you are too heavy to be thrown, and this result has no effect. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

You remain unconscious, even after being stabilised. Following a long rest, make a death saving throw. Three failed saves result in death (possibly due to lack of fluids, amongst other complications), but a result of 15 or means the coma ends. If and when you awaken, you suffer three levels of exhaustion (these exhaustion levels can be removed normally). The coma can also be ended prematurely by magic such as Dream, Remove Curse, Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

Due to system shock, you must make a death saving throw immediately, with disadvantage on the roll. Following recovery, you can no longer hold anything with two hands, and can hold only a single object at a time. Additionally, if the lost arm was your dominant arm (50% chance), unless you are trained in the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you suffer disadvantage with weapon attacks until you learn to use your off-hand.

While this flaw remains, you can only stabilise naturally after five death saving throws, rather than three. Following recovery, even routine activity leaves you breathless, and you are wracked with coughing fits when the air is thin or smoky. For every four hours spent walking (or eight hours riding), and when reduced to half your maximum hit points or less, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion levels gained from this flaw are lost during a short or long rest, or can be removed by a character equipped with a herbalism kit with which they are proficient. Finally, this flaw ends if you succeed at a DC 17 Constitution saving throw rolled at the beginning of every month, or if removed by Heal, Greater Restoration, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>12-13</td><th>Severe Hypothermia</th><td> Reduced core body heat leaves you with pale puffy skin, blue extremities and lips, and confusion. Your speed is halved (rounded up) and, in combat, you count as if you are subject to the confusion spell (although you cannot make Wisdom saving throws to end the effect as in the standard spell). This flaw ends if you succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw rolled after a long rest, or you receive magic such as Greater Restoration, Protection from Energy (cold) or Wish. At the Dungeon Master's discretion, sources of intense heat may allow you to make an additional saving throw. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

However, following every long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (your choice), or gain a level of exhaustion. If you fail this saving throw by 5 or more, you gain two levels. Accumulating enough exhaustion levels can lead to your death. However, if you roll an unmodified 20, this flaw ends, and can also be ended by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

Roll 1d3: 1: you lose 1d3 toes; 2: you lose 1d3 fingers; 3: you lose 1d3 fingers and 1d3 toes. If you lose toes, your foot speed is reduced by 5 feet. If you lose fingers, there is a 50% chance of the affected hand being your dominant hand. You can just about carry a shield, but if it's a weapon hand, your weapon attacks suffer a -2 penalty, unless you are trained in either the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style. Also, if it is your dominant hand, if you attempt to cast a spell with somatic components, you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost.

While affected by this flaw, you only recover a quarter of your hit dice (rounded up) during a long rest. After a long rest, you can make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw (with advantage if resistant to cold damage): on a success, this flaw ends – otherwise, it remains until you succeed on a future roll, or until you are the subject of magic such as Heal, Greater Restoration, Protection from Energy (cold) or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>38-39</td><th>Wave of Ice</th><td>A freak burst of elemental ice blossoms where you fall. All other creatures within 10-foot range of you must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or suffer 2d6 cold damage. Additionally, this 10 feet radius of floor is frozen for up to one minute, counting as difficult terrain. A creature attempting to move across this area before it thaws must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>40-41</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards dragons or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of snow). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>42-43</td><th>Horrible Scar</th><td> If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), you are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed, or palated. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magic like Heal, Regenerate or Wish can remove the scar. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Cold Heart</th><td>By some freak coincidence, the intensity of the frost opens the briefest of rifts to the Plane of Elemental Water and you are permanently infused with the smallest fragment of energy from that plane. Your body becomes icy cold to the touch and, from now on, you reduce fire damage that you suffer by -3 per attack, and your own unarmed attacks inflict an additional 1 point of magical cold damage. Additionally, once per long rest, upon striking a foe within 10 feet, you can choose to channel an additional 2d6 magical cold damage against the target. This costs no action. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Remove Curse or Wish.</td></tr>

This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>17-18</td><th>Leg Wound</th><td>Your leg is badly damaged. Until a base recovery time of 40 days has passed (see Recovery above), you must use a cane or crutch to move at half speed, you fall prone after using the dash action, and you suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Even after the worst of the damage has passed, your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. The limb can be restored by either Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>19-21</td><th>Hand Injury</th><td>The attack costs you several fingers. There is a 50% chance of the affected hand being your dominant hand. You can just about carry a shield, but if it's a weapon hand, your weapon attacks suffer a -2 penalty, unless you are trained in either the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style. Also, if it is your dominant hand, if you attempt to cast a spell with somatic components, you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. These penalties last a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>22-23</td><th>Troubled Sleep</th><td>Unless you are immune to being frightened, you suffer the following flaw: though you more or less recover, your sleep or trance is ravaged by inescapable nightmares, and rarely affords much rest. You must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma or Wisdom saving throw (your choice) after every long rest, or only recover a quarter of your hit dice. If you beat the save DC by 10 or more, the flaw ends. It can also be removed by magic such as Dream, Greater Restoration, Remove Curse or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>24-26</td><th>Ruined Armor</th><td>Unless your armour is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it badly damaged, affording little protection and fitting badly. You suffer -2 from your AC. This penalty lasts until it is replaced, repaired or subject to a Mending spell. If you have no armour, treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>27-30</td><td>Useless Shield</td><td>Unless your shield is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it ruined and worthless. It provides no bonus to AC until it is repaired or subjected to a mending spell. If you don't have a shield, treat this result as Ruined Armour. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>31-33</td><th>Infected Wounds</th><td>The damage refuses to properly heal, and instead becomes swollen and leaks a noisome pus. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 for every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive the spell Heal Minor Injury or, alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. Characters who are immune to disease treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>34-35</td><th>Personality Change</th><td>In the aftermath of the attack, due to post-traumatic stress, you soon exhibit a shift in personality. Roll 1d100 and consult the Indefinite Madness table (on page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to see what permanent flaw you gain. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish, or possibly by some kind of long-term therapy, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>36-37</td><th>Aaaaaaarghhhhh!</th><td>Unless you are immune to being frightened, you panic as the flames consume you, slamming bodily into a creature that interrupts your maddened flight. You immediately move up to half your speed (rounded up) towards a random creature and attempt a shove (either to knock prone or push, your choice); this movement can result in opportunity attacks. If the shove succeeds, you also inflict 1d6 fire damage. Following this attack, you then fall unconscious, and begin making death saving throws as usual. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>38-40</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards dragons or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of fire). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>41-43</td><th>Horrible Scar</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), you are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed, or palated. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magic like Heal, Regenerate or Wish can remove the scar. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Fire Touched</th><td>By some freak coincidence, the intensity of the flame opens the briefest of rifts to the Plane of Elemental Fire and, you become permanently infused with the smallest fragment of energy from that plane. Your body radiates heat and, from now on, you reduce cold damage that you suffer by -3 per attack, and your own unarmed attacks inflict an additional 1 point of magical fire damage. Additionally, once per long rest, upon striking a foe within 10 feet, you can choose to channel an additional 2d6 magical fire damage against the target. This costs no action, but if a nonmagical wooden weapon is used to channel this flame, it is destroyed. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Remove Curse or Wish.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>99+</td><th>I'm... I'm Alright!</th><td>The gods must be smiling today – the blow seemed worse than it actually is, and you are assumed dead. Rather than making any death saving throws, you are instead stabilised and returned to 1 hit point and, at the beginning of your next turn, regain 1d10 hit points and can act as normal, gaining advantage on your first attack that turn.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>40-41</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards dragons or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of storms).

Your body flickers with static, and from now on anyone who hits you in melee must succeed at a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1d6 magical lightning damage, and your unarmed attacks inflict an additional 1 point of magical lightning damage. This costs no action. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Remove Curse or Wish.</td></tr>

The energy of the rogue magic contracts into a super-dense point at your heart and begins to drags all ambient magic inwards – seconds later, your remains crumple silently inward, and all that remains is an orb of impenetrable dark force – a sphere of annihilation! You die instantly and your remains and equipment are destroyed (with the possible exception of any artifact in your possession) and, at the beginning of what would be your next turn, a sphere of annihilation occupies your former space. You can now only be brought back by a Wish.</td></tr>

You die instantly, and at the beginning of what would be your next turn (if you have not been magically revived somehow), a spectre rises in your space. You can now only be brought back by powerful magic like Reincarnate, True Resurrection or Wish.</td></tr>

Even if you succeed at the normal death saving throws, you remain unconscious and will die after 1d6 turns have passed, at the end of your turn, unless you are magically healed above 0 hit points, or stabilised with a DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check using a healer's kit. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

You remain unconscious, even after being stabilised. Following a long rest, make a death saving throw. Three failed saves result in death (possibly due to lack of fluids, amongst other complications), but a result of 15 or means the coma ends.

Following recovery, you can no longer hold anything with two hands, and can hold only a single object at a time. The distraction of the pain means that if you attempt to cast any spell you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. Finally, if the lost arm was your dominant arm (50% chance), unless you are trained in the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you suffer disadvantage with weapon attacks until you learn to use your off-hand.

Additionally, you fall prone after using the dash action, and suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance.

While this flaw remains, you can only stabilise naturally after five death saving throws, rather than three. Following recovery, even routine activity leaves you breathless, and you are wracked with coughing fits when the air is thin or smoky. For every four hours spent walking (or eight hours riding), and when reduced to half your maximum hit points or less, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion levels gained from this flaw are lost during a short or long rest, or can be removed by a character equipped with a herbalism kit with which they are proficient. Finally, this flaw ends if you succeed at a DC 17 Constitution saving throw rolled at the beginning of every month, or if removed by Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>18-19</td><th>Ruined Eye</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), one of your eyes is destroyed. From now on, you suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and on ranged attack rolls. If a subsequent injury damages your other eye, you are permanently blinded. Magic such as Regenerate or Wish can restore the lost eye. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>20-22</td><th>Pelvic Injury</th><td>Either your pelvis is struck a crippling blow, or the attack destroys your nethers. Whenever you attempt a Strength (Athletics) check or take any action in combat (other than casting a spell), you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose 1d6 hit points. You also can't ride a horse without suffering 1d10 hit points. Finally, this injury renders you permanently infertile. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 70 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, although the infertility can only be removed by Greater Restoration or Remove Curse. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>23-24</td><th>Agonizing Wound</th><td>The injury plagues you with flashes of searing pain from time to time. Whenever you attempt a Strength (Athletics) check or attempt to take any action in combat (other than casting a spell), you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If you fail the save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 70 days (see Recovery above), and is also removed by magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>25-27</td><th>Crippling Fatigue</th><td>You can never shake your sense of tiredness, and gain one level of exhaustion. This can be removed normally. However, following every long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (your choice), or gain a level of exhaustion. If you fail this saving throw by 5 or more, you gain two levels. Accumulating enough exhaustion levels can lead to your death. However, if you roll an unmodified 20, this flaw ends, and can also be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>28-31</td><th>Stolen Life</th><td>Unless you are immune to magical ageing, you physically age by 1d6 years, and are rendered infertile. For every year you age, you suffer an additional 1d4 necrotic damage: this damage may lead to instant death. If this flaw is inflicted by a creature (or a spell cast by one), then that creature gains temporary hit points equal to the additional necrotic damage inflicted. The infertility can only be reversed by magic such as either Remove Curse or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>32-34</td><th>Troubled Sleep</th><td>Unless you are immune to being frightened, you suffer the following flaw: though you more or less recover, your sleep or trance is ravaged by inescapable nightmares, and rarely affords much rest. You must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma or Wisdom saving throw (your choice) after every long rest, or only recover a quarter of your hit dice. If you beat the save DC by 10 or more, the flaw ends. It can also be removed by magic such as Dream, Greater Restoration, Remove Curse or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>35-38</td><th>Infected Wounds</th><td>The damage refuses to properly heal, and instead becomes swollen and leaks a noisome pus. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 for every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive the spell Heal Minor Injury or, alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. Characters who are immune to disease treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>39-40</td><th>Personality Change</th><td>In the aftermath of the attack, due to post-traumatic stress, you soon exhibit a shift in personality. Roll 1d100 and consult the Indefinite Madness table (on page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to see what permanent flaw you gain. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish, or possibly by some kind of long-term therapy, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>41-42</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards undead or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of germs). This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>43-44</td><th>Horrible Scar</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), you are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed, or palated. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magic like Heal, Regenerate or Wish can remove the scar.

                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Dead One</th><td>The necrotic energy fails to overcome your will to live, but instead somehow alters you into a being not undead, but not entirely living either. Diminutive plants and beasts (with 1 hit point or less) die within 5 feet of you, and the condition of the sick, elderly and young in your presence worsen. People with whom you have regular contact begin to find you 'wrong' in some intangible way. You reduce necrotic damage that you suffer by -3 per attack. Additionally, most undead fail to perceive you as a living being, and unintelligent undead (such as zombies or skeletons) tend to ignore you, unless you take hostile action. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Remove Curse or Wish.</td></tr>

You remain unconscious, even after being stabilised. Following a long rest, make a death saving throw. Three failed saves result in death (possibly due to lack of fluids, amongst other complications), but a result of 15 or means the coma ends.

Following recovery, you can no longer hold anything with two hands, and can hold only a single object at a time. The distraction of the pain means that if you attempt to cast any spell you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost.

Until you are stabilised, you must make two death saving throws a turn. Following recovery, even routine activity leaves you breathless, and you are wracked with coughing fits when the air is thin or smoky. For every four hours spent walking (or eight hours riding), and when reduced to half your maximum hit points or less, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion levels gained from this flaw are lost during a short or long rest, or can be removed by a character equipped with a herbalism kit with which they are proficient. Finally, this flaw ends if you succeed at a DC 17 Constitution saving throw rolled at the beginning of every month, or if removed by magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>22-24</td><th>Impaired Mind</th><td>Unless you are immune to poison, the venom permanently damages your mental facilities somehow. Roll 1d3: 1: you lose 1 point from your Intelligence score; 2: you lose 1 point from your Wisdom score; 3: you lose 1 point from your Charisma score. This flaw is often accompanied by speech or memory problems, requiring you to relearn basic skills and social niceties. If the same ability score is affected a second time or more in the future by this flaw, you must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or also suffer the Coma flaw. This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

Whenever you attempt a Strength (Athletics) check or take any action in combat (other than casting a spell), you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose 1d6 hit points. You also can't ride a horse without suffering 1d10 hit points. Finally, this injury renders you permanently infertile. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 70 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, although the infertility can only be reversed by Greater Restoration or Remove Curse. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>29-31</td><th>Leg Wound</th><td>Your leg is badly damaged. Until a base recovery time of 40 days has passed (see Recovery above), you must use a cane or crutch to move at half speed, you fall prone after using the dash action, and you suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Even after the worst of the damage has passed, your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. The limb can be restored by Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>32-35</td><th>Liver Failure</th><td>The poison was almost too much you, and from now on you suffer vulnerability to all poison damage, and can no longer tolerate other toxins, such as alcohol. No more tavern crawls for you! This flaw overrides any existing resistance you may have to poison, and can only be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>36-39</td><th>Crippling Fatigue</th><td>You can never shake your sense of tiredness, and gain one level of exhaustion. This can be removed normally. However, following every long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (your choice), or gain a level of exhaustion. If you fail this saving throw by 5 or more, you gain two levels. Accumulating enough exhaustion levels can lead to your death. However, if you roll an unmodified 20, this flaw ends, and can also be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>40-41</td><th>Personality Change</th><td>In the aftermath of the attack, due to post-traumatic stress, you soon exhibit a shift in personality. Roll 1d100 and consult the Indefinite Madness table (on page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to see what permanent flaw you gain. This flaw can only be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish, or possibly by some kind of long-term therapy, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>42-43</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards spiders or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of wine). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Mithraditic Resistance</th><td>Your body rapidly develops a resistance to the venom that borders on the miraculous! If you succeed at a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, you are completely immune to that venom. If you fail, you instead have resistance to poison damage of the specific venom you were injured by, gain advantage on saves against its effects, and the duration of its effects on you are halved. This result overrides any existing vulnerability they may have to that venom.</td></tr>

You are almost entirely useless, though you can be persuaded to stumble along meekly when feeling more placid – however, there is a 50% chance (checked for after each short or long rest) that you will scream uncontrollably, unless drugged, knocked out or subject to a calm emotions spell.

You can do little more than speak, but can still cast spells that don't require somatic components. However, as you can't feel much of your body, you gain advantage on any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on spells due to receiving damage.

This flaw is often accompanied by speech or memory problems, requiring you to relearn basic skills and social niceties.

                <tr><td>12-14</td><th>Recurring Possession</th><td>Even if the attacker is eventually destroyed, a fragment of its spirit burrows itself deep within your psyche, making you commit horrors when you suspect yourself safe. Every time you take a long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the attacking creature (or its spirit) for up to 1d10 minutes, in a manner similar to the dominate spell. As with the spell, you can repeat your saving throw if you suffer damage. When the possession ends, you have no memory of what you have done. This possession can typically be noticed by a change in your mannerisms when possessed, and also by a detect magic spell at any time. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration, Remove Curse or Wish, or possibly by destroying or confronting the possessing spirit, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>15-18</td><th>Debilitating Migraines</th><td>The attack permanently damaged your brain, and you become plagued with nosebleeds and nauseating headaches. These come most frequently in times of stress, or following loud noise. When rolling for initiative at the start of combat, or when you suffer thunder damage, you must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If you fail the save, the migraines come again: you suffer disadvantage on future initiative and Wisdom (Perception) checks. The migraine attack ends when you take a short or long rest.

You must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma or Wisdom saving throw (your choice) after every long rest, or only recover a quarter of your hit dice. If you beat the save DC by 10 or more, the flaw ends.

                <tr><td>35-37</td><th>Pushed to the Brink</th><td>Unless you are immune to being frightened, your mind is rendered brittle. You become over-emotional and prone to regular fits of crying, suffer disadvantage on checks or saving throws related to avoiding being frightened, and may react strongly to certain enchantment spells (at the Dungeon Master's discretion). This ends when you make a successful DC 17 Charisma or Wisdom saving throw (your choice) rolled at the beginning of each month – this saving throw can also be made if you are subject to a Calm Emotions spell.

From now on, you reduce psychic damage that you suffer by -3 per attack and, if attacked with psychic damage by a creature, you can use a reaction to make an opposed contest against the attacker (using your choice of Wisdom or Charisma against the attacker's Charisma). If you win the contest, the attacker suffers the same amount of psychic damage as you. Finally, if a creature attempts to read your mind, the would-be intruder suffers disadvantage on their attempt, and you gain advantage on rolls to resist.</td></tr>

You also can't ride a horse without suffering 1d10 hit points. Finally, this injury renders you permanently infertile. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 70 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish, although the infertility can only be reversed by Greater Restoration or Remove Curse. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>27-28</td><th>Leg Wound</th><td>Your leg is badly damaged. Until a base recovery time of 40 days has passed (see Recovery above), you must use a cane or crutch to move at half speed, you fall prone after using the dash action, and you suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Even after the worst of the damage has passed, your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. The limb can be restored by either Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>29-30</td><th>Hand Injury</th><td>The attack costs you several fingers. There is a 50% chance of the affected hand being your dominant hand. You can just about carry a shield, but if it's a weapon hand, your weapon attacks suffer a -2 penalty, unless you are trained in either the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style. Also, if it is your dominant hand, if you attempt to cast a spell with somatic components, you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. These penalties last a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>31-32</td><th>Ruined Armor</th><td>Unless your armour is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it badly damaged, affording little protection and fitting badly. You suffer -2 from your AC. This penalty lasts until it is replaced, repaired or subject to a Mending spell. If you have no armour, treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>33-34</td><th>Old Battle Wound</th><td>You more or less recover, but become plagued for years with recurring pains. After every long rest, you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer -2 to your Dexterity and Wisdom scores until the next long rest. This penalty can be neutralised by special salves, prepared by a character proficient in Medicine or using a herbalism kit with which they are proficient. This flaw can be removed through magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>35-36</td><th>Useless Shield</th><td>Unless your shield is made of adamantine, the attack leaves it ruined and worthless. It provides no bonus to AC until it is repaired or subjected to a mending spell. If you don't have a shield, treat this result as Ruined Armour. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>37-38</td><th>Blinding Refraction</th><td>The focused beam not only puts you down, but also, by sheer chance, reflects off a shiny surface to strike another creature. A random creature without total cover from you (possibly including the attacker) must succeed at a DC14 Dexterity saving throw (this roll is made with advantage if they have half or three-quarters cover), or be blinded until the end of their next turn. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>39-41</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards angels or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of sunlight). This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>42-44</td><th>Horrible Scar</th><td>If you wear a helmet, you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw – if you fail (or have no helmet), you are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed, or palated. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magic like Heal, Regenerate or Wish can remove the scar. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>45-96</td><th>Exhausted</th><td>It will take time to fully recover from your wounds and you are exhausted. Gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Sun-Blessed</th><td>Either due to some purity inherent in your nature, or as part of an unknowable divine plan, the holy radiance imbues itself permanently into your mortal shell. Your skin or eyes seem to glimmer with astral radiance, and you can use a bonus action to cause your skin to glow with a soft light, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet – this can be turned off with another bonus action, and also turns off if you fall unconscious. Additionally, once per long rest, you can cast the bless spell as a 1st level spell, without using up a spell slot. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Protection from Evil and Good or Wish.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>99+</td><th>I'm... I'm Alright!</th><td>The gods must be smiling today – the blow seemed worse than it actually is, and you are assumed dead. Rather than making any death saving throws, you are instead stabilised and returned to 1 hit point and, at the beginning of your next turn, regain 1d10 hit points and can act as normal, gaining advantage on your first attack that turn.</td></tr>

Even if you succeed at the normal death saving throws, you remain unconscious and will die after 1d6 turns have passed, at the end of your turn, unless you are magically healed above 0 hit points, or stabilised with a DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check using a healer's kit. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

Even if you succeed at the normal death saving throws and regain consciousness, you are capable of nothing more strenuous than moving at half speed (rounded up), cannot take actions, bonus actions or reactions, and will die after a number of hours equal to your Constitution score, unless you are subject to powerful healing like Heal, Regenerate or Wish. Alternatively, if a character spends a use of a healer's kit and succeeds at a DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check, then you will be stabilised and able to undertake normal activity after a long rest. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

You will need carrying or some sort of device to allow mobility (otherwise you can only crawl 5 feet per turn), and count as restrained. Still, there is always hope for a particularly strong person: at the beginning of every week, you can make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw – on a success, you miraculously recover. Otherwise, this flaw only ends if you receive powerful magic such as Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><th>Severed Arm</th><td>Your arm or hand is hacked off, pumping arterial blood everywhere. Due to the flow of blood, you lose 1d6 hit points at the end of each of your turns, unless you receive magical healing to seal the stump, it is cauterised by fire or radiant damage, or another character uses an action to apply a tourniquet. Due to system shock, you must make a death saving throw immediately, with disadvantage on the roll. Following recovery, you can no longer hold anything with two hands, and can hold only a single object at a time. The distraction of the pain means that if you attempt to cast any spell you must first succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or lose your action that turn – the spell slot, if any, is not lost. Finally, if the lost arm was your dominant arm (50% chance), unless you are trained in the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you suffer disadvantage with weapon attacks until you learn to use your off-hand. You learn to live with this pain and train your off-hand after a base recovery time of 40 days (see Recovery above). The limb can be restored by either Regenerate or Wish.

Due to system shock, you must make a death saving throw immediately, with disadvantage on the roll. Following recovery, your speed on foot is halved and you must use a cane or crutch to move, unless you receive a prosthesis of some kind.

You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>10-11</td><th>I Can't Move!</th><td>Brain trauma leaves you fully paralysed, at least for a short time. You can do little more than speak, but can still cast spells that don't require somatic components. However, as you can't feel much of your body, you gain advantage on any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on spells due to receiving damage. After every long rest, the character can make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw to end the paralysis. This flaw can also be ended by magic such as Freedom of Movement, Greater Restoration, Heal Minor Injury, Remove Curse or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

Roll 1d3: 1: you lose 1 point from your Intelligence score; 2: you lose 1 point from your Wisdom score; 3: you lose 1 point from your Charisma score. This flaw is often accompanied by speech or memory problems, requiring you to relearn basic skills and social niceties. If the same ability score is affected a second time or more in the future by this flaw, you must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or also suffer the Coma flaw. This flaw can be removed by Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>20-21</td><th>Broken Arm</th><td>As the attack slams home, an audible 'crack' renders an arm close to useless for a time. There is a 50% chance that the broken arm is your dominant arm and if so, unless you are trained in the Dual Wielder feat or the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you suffer disadvantage with weapon attacks. If it is your other arm, you cannot wear a shield. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 30 weeks (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as a Greater Restoration, Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

Whenever you attempt a Strength (Athletics) check or attempt to take any action in combat (other than casting a spell), you must succeed at a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If you fail the save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. This flaw ends after a base recovery time of 50 days (see Recovery above), or if you receive magic such as Heal, Regenerate or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>28-29</td><th>Scalp Cut</th><td>Unless you are wearing a helmet, you suffer the following flaw: it's only a shallow wound, but that doesn't seem to stop it bleeding profusely, and blinding you with your own blood. When you roll for initiative at the start of combat, on the result of an odd number, you are blinded. You can use a bonus action to wipe away the blood to avoid being blinded until the beginning of your next turn. This flaw ends either by receiving the spell Heal Minor Injury, or after a long rest. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>30-31</td><th>Bleeding Wound</th><td>Frustratingly, the latest injury is loathe to stop bleeding. When you roll for initiative at the start of combat, on the result of an odd number, the wound re-opens: you suffer 1 damage at the end of each of your turns, unless a character uses an action to bind the wound. This flaw ends if you receive the spell Heal Minor Injury, or if you succeed at a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after a long rest: if you fail this save the first time, you gain a +5 bonus in future. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>37-38</td><th>Infected Wounds</th><td>The damage refuses to properly heal, and instead becomes swollen and leaks a noisome pus. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 for every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive the spell Heal Minor Injury or, alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. Characters who are immune to disease treat this result as Exhausted instead. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>39-40</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation.

                <tr><td>45-46</td><th>Fixation</th><td>Following recovery, you develop an unhealthy fixation. Roll 1d6: on a 1-3, you nurture a bitter enmity; on a 4-6, you develop an overpowering phobia. If you are immune to being frightened, then this result is bitter enmity. You should work with the Dungeon Master on the phrasing of the new flaw: your hatred or phobia may focus on some element of the attacker's identity (for example, a mindless hatred towards elementals or sorcerers) or even the type of attack (such as a fear of storms). This flaw can be removed by magic such as Greater Restoration or Wish. You also gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>47-96</td><th>Exhausted</th><td>It will take time to fully recover from your wounds and you are exhausted. Gain 1 level of exhaustion.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>97-98</td><th>Thunder-Born</th><td>By some freak coincidence, the intensity of the sound opens the briefest of rifts to the Plane of Elemental Air and you become permanently infused with the smallest fragment of energy from that plane. In moments of anger or excitement, ambient thunder rolls protectively around you. You can use a reaction to gain resistance to thunder and lightning damage until the beginning of your next turn, but a growling wave of thunder sweeps out, audible up to 100 feet away, and creatures within 5 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1d6 thunder damage. Finally, when you spend more than three nights in one area, it is likely that natural storms will begin to form in the vicinity. This flaw can only be removed by magic such as Remove Curse or Wish.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>99+</td><th>I'm... I'm Alright!</th><td>The gods must be smiling today – the blow seemed worse than it actually is, and you are assumed dead. Rather than making any death saving throws, you are instead stabilised and returned to 1 hit point and, at the beginning of your next turn, regain 1d10 hit points and can act as normal, gaining advantage on your first attack that turn.</td></tr>
