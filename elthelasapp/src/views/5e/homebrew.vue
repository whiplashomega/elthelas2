      I use a wide variety of homebrew rules at my table. Ranging from small changes to classes and races, to variations on how parts of the game are played. This page is an (incomplete) list of the rules currently in use at my gaming table. If you are running a game in the setting you have the choice of what homebrew rules you want to use (with the consent of your players). Remember, in general this sort of thing should be discussed at session 0. Many of these come from other sources, though I can't necessarily remember what they all are.
    </p>
    <p>
      New homebrew rules tend to go through the following stages:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Initial Design: At this point I am still deciding if I want or need a new rule or feature for a particular purpose, what I want it to accomplish, and what general shape it should take.</li>
      <li>Proposal: After the initial design is written and ready I present it to my players for a readthrough and feedback. I answer questions about my intent, and make alterations based on their feedback.</li>
      <li>Play Test: Most rules will be tried first in a one shot session or implemented on a trial basis before long-term acceptance.</li>
      <li>Adoption: The rule is adopted by the table for general use.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Rules Currently In Use</h2>
    
    <h3>General Rules</h3>
    <p><strong>Character Factions.</strong> Characters may belong to one or more major factions in the world. These factions require the character to complete missions and act in their interest, but so long as the character remains in good standing with the faction, they also gain bonus features and abilities from being a member, including specific bonuses at character levels 1 and 10. See the <router-link to="/world/orgs">Major Organizations</router-link> page for details on individual factions, and I would encourage DMs to work with their players to create custom factions that fit what the character is looking for.</p>
    <p><strong>Group Skill Checks.</strong> Skill checks that require everyone to succeed to be a success (such as moving stealthily as a group) are made by averaging the result. So everyone in the party roles their dice, adds their modifiers, and then the results are averaged to determine if the group succeeds or fails. Skill checks that require only one person in the group to succeed should only have one person roll. That person can roll with advantage if more than one party member is attempting to do the action. The players can choose who among them makes the check.</p>
    <p><strong>Injuries.</strong> In most of my games we use an injury table to determine if characters have long lasting injuries from being knocked out in combat. The injury table can be found in the <router-link to="/ref/quick">Quick Reference Manual.</router-link></p>
    <p><strong>Somatic and Material Components.</strong> The hand holding your spell focus can be used for somatic components of spells, in addition to the spell focus replacing the need for material components without a cost.</p>
    <p><strong>Sources Allowed.</strong> I allow players to use any feat, class, spell, or background published in an official WotC book for 5th edition that is not designed for a specific setting or adventure. In general this means they must come from one of the following books: The Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, Mordenkainen's tome of Foes, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, Fizban's Treasure of Dragons, or Monsters of the Multiverse. Character Races must come from the related page on this site.</p>
    <p><strong>Strongholds.</strong> At certain points in a campaign the characters may get control of, or have the option to found, a castle or town. The <router-link to="/tools/stronghold">Stronghold Builder</router-link> is an online engine designed to create a uniform way to manage that castle or town.</p>
    <p><strong>Tool Use and Ability Checks.</strong> If an ability check requires the use of a set of tools listed in the Players Handbook, proficiency in the tool is used instead of proficiency in any other skill. For example, when attempting to pick a lock with thieves' tools, use thieves tools proficiency, slight of hand does not apply. Which ability to use continues to depend on what exactly the player is doing.</p>
    
    <h3>Class Changes</h3>
    <p><strong>All Classes.</strong> All classes have access to the bonus features presented in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.</p>
    <p><strong>Barbarian: Less Exhausting Frenzy.</strong> Frenzy does not cause exhaustion the first time it is used after a long rest.</p>

However, they must use one or the other for all of their selections, not both. See the <router-link to="/options/class">Character Classes</router-link> page for details.</p>

    <h2>Rules Currently in Testing</h2>
    <p>
      These changes are currently in the proposal or play test stages.
    </p>
    <h3>General Rules</h3>
    <p><strong>Advanced Weapons Table.</strong> The advanced weapons table is intended to make weapons <em>better</em>. Each weapon is unique, and every attempt has been made to make them balanced against each other as well. What they are not is balanced against the <em>current weapons table</em>. As such this rule when implemented will be paired with the improved class spell weapon dice feature below. The Advanced Weapons Table can be found in the <router-link to="/ref/quick">Quick Reference Manual.</router-link> </p>
    <p><strong>Initiative Jumping.</strong> If a particular action would trigger intiative (such as declaring an attack during a social encounter, or attacking an enemy from stealth). The character or creature that declared that action does not roll initiative, but is instead automatically at the top of the initiative order before other initiative rules are applied. Only one character or creature can jump initiative.</p>
    <p><strong>Set Initiative for Enemies.</strong> Enemy initiative is always equal to 10 + their modifier (add or subtract 5 for advantage/disadvantage).</p>
    <p><strong>Exhaustion.</strong> In the <router-link to="/ref/quick">conditions section of the quick reference manual</router-link> you will find the exhaustion rule. It is a modified version of the one from the OneDND play test.</p>
    
    <h3>Class Changes</h3>
    <p><strong>Artificer: Armor Model Increased Damage.</strong> Damage dice for Artificer Armorer's Armor Models is increased. Thunder Gauntlet damage increases to 1d10, and the Lightning Launcher's damage increases to 1d8. This is meant to be paired with the Advanced Weapons Table.</p>
    <p><strong>Barbarian: Form of the Beast Increased Damage.</strong> Damage dice for Form of the Beast natural weapon attacks is increased. The tail and bite attacks do 1d10 damage, while the claws do 1d8. This is meant to be paired with the Advanced Weapons Table.</p>
    <p><strong>Monk: Martial Arts.</strong> The Monks Martial Arts die increases in size by 1 die size. So a 1d4 becomes 1d6, 1d6 becomes 1d8, 1d8 becomes 1d10, and 1d10 becomes 1d12. If magic items would increase this further, 1d12 becomes 2d8, and 2d8 becomes 3d6. This is meant to be paired with the Advanced Weapons Table.</p>
    <p><strong>Rogue: Psychic Blades</strong> The Rogue Soulknife's Psychic Blades feature has its damage increased to 1d8 on the main attack, and 1d6 for bonus action attacks. This is meant to be paired with the Advanced Weapons Table.</p>
    <p><strong>Warlock: Spell Slots Increase.</strong> This homebrew change increases the spell slots of the warlock class to be equal to the characters proficiency bonus (for single class warlocks), or what their proficiency bonus would be if they only had their warlock levels (for multiclass warlocks). This is available in the character builder under Warlock (Joe's Edit) class.</p>
    <p><strong>Warlock: Pact of the Blade/Hexblade Refactor.</strong> This change moves most of the Hexblade's level 1 bonuses to the Pact of the Blade feature. Specifically moved are: Charisma based weapon attacks with the Pact Weapon, proficiency with Medium Armor, shields, and martial weapons. Hexblades retain the Hex Curse ability as exclusive to them as their first level feature. Available in the Character Builder under Warlock (Joe's Edit)</p>
    <p><strong>Wizard: Bladesinger Abilities Refactor.</strong> The Bladesong ability has been refactored. The changes are: 1. it no longer provides an AC bonus. It instead provides a bonus to weapon damage and temporary hit points. Song of Victory has been moved to 10th level and now provides an additional 1d8 force damage (instead of intelligence to damage). Song of Defense has been moved to 14th level and now provides the ability to recover temporary hit points on enemy death by weapon attack (instead of expending spell slots to reduce damage). These changes are available in the character builder as "College of Bladesingers (homebrew)"</p>
    <h3>Feats</h3>
    <p><strong>Dual Flurry.</strong> A feat meant to further enhance two-weapon fighting by granting a second off-hand attack when the correct conditions are met, the idea for this came from the Solasta Community Expansion mod. See the <router-link to="/options/feats">Feats</router-link> page for details.</p>
