      The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the planes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Planes in Elthelas are geographically coexistent, but the actual matter making them up is separated by barriers of arcane force. Thus, planes being adjacent is simply describing that there is only one barrier between them. Since cutting through multiple planar barriers at once requires exponentially more energy, planar travel typically requires movement through adjacent planes.

    <h3>Planar Travel</h3>
    <p>
      When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells.</strong> A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any adjacent plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the astral projection spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Portals.</strong> A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).
    </p>
    <h3>The Planes of Creation</h3>
    <p>
      These are the planes derived from the essence of Gaian, the heart of creation. The geography of each of these planes is mirrored between them, the root of which is the Material, and all the others being reflections of that.

    <h3>The Transitive Planes</h3>
    <p>The Transitive Planes are not "true" planes in the same sense as the others. While it is possible to travel to them, they exist as the spaces between planes. As such they can be used to connect to other planes of existence. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p>
    
    <h4>Etherium, or the Ethereal Plane</h4>
    <h5>Traits</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Home of: </strong>Mystikinae</li>
      <li><strong>Gravity: </strong>No Gravity</li>
      <li><strong>Time: </strong>Normal</li>
      <li><strong>Morphism: </strong>Normal</li>
      <li><strong>Elementalism: </strong>None</li>
      <li><strong>Magic: </strong>Normal</li>
      <li><strong>Special: </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Etherium, also called the Etherial Plane, is a hazy reflection of the material plane, where distances and time are not absolute, and it is almost impossible to navigate. It is possible to see easily from Etherium to Elthelas, but nearly impossible to see Etherium from Elthelas. Etherium is the easiest plane to pass into or out of from the Material.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a transitive plane the ethereal plane connects the inner portions of the planes of creation, and you can travel to each of them with relative ease if you know the correct incantations. Each of these planes is a rough reflection of the material plane, and traveling between them leaves you at the same point in space, on the new plane of existence. However distances are not always uniform, and traveling a certain distance on one of these inner planes could take you farther or shorter as compared to the material.

    <p><strong>Home of: </strong> Nera</p>
    <p>Logos the great plane of ideas. It is said nothing exists that does not have its perfected form in Logos. Logos is separated into 4 sections, at the center of which is the Confluence, An island on which Nera's palace sits. The four quadrants around it are the Negative Energy Sea, which flows from Necronus; the Positive Energy Sea, which flows from Celestia; The Plains of Stillness, containing the road to Mechanus, and The Seas of Chance, a chaotic realm that flows out from Mercuria.</p>
    <p>Logos connects the inner planes of concept with the elemental planes. It is sometimes posited that it is the mixing of Logos and the Elemental Chaos that allowed the elemental planes to form, with Logos bringing form and predictability to the raw energy of the Elemental Chaos.</p>

    <p>
      The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.
    </p>
    <p>The Astral Sea connects the various planes of concept together as well as connecting them to the material. It is easily traversed, being a plane of pure thought, but traveling through the Astral Sea to a particular location on purpose is almost impossible, as the portals do not stay put, and can open and close randomly.</p>

      <li><strong>Special: </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A realm of twisted minds, madness, and beings beyond the comprehension of mortals. Ocassionally a being from here will become interested in the mortal realm and reach out to touch mortal minds. These beings take many forms and titles, and their interests do not align with anything in particular besides their own curiosity, but those touched by them invariably suffer insanities that put them beyond the mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Far Realm connects the planes of effect to each other, however traveling from plane to plane is almost completely uncontrolable. One instant you are in the Far Realm, the next you are lost in Temerus. Reaching the Far Realm typically requires connecting via one of the outer planes of concept, such as The Nine Hells, The Abyss, or Mirrodeum, however the connection is one-way.

    <h5>Planes Reachable from The Nothingness Beyond</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>None</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Home of: </strong> Zhuul</p>
    <p>Where the Far Realm is a land full of madness beyond comprehension, aberrations, and beings beyond the comprehension of mortals, the nothingness beyond is a great empty space. A void where nothing at all can survive. Zhuul embodies this concept of nothingness, and as such has no real home on this plane, but rather encompasses all of it, and none of it. For he is nothingness, and The Nothingness Beyond contains nothing.</p>
    <p>The Nothingness is a transitive plane in that it is not a true singular place. However, no one knows if there is anything beyond the nothing, as it is not traversable by any known means.</p>

<hr />
    <h3>The Planes of Concept</h3>
    <h4>Celestia</h4>
    <p><strong>Home of: </strong> Alohim, Amathera</p>
    <p>
      A realm of peace and rest, Celestia serves as the source of radiant light. No shadows exist in Celestia, and it is eternally daytime. It is dominated by the massive Mount Celestia, whose slopes cannot be measured but instead measure the worth of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The base of the mountain is dominated by the City of the Righteous, a place of kindness and giving that is the home of Amathera. There she travels from home to home, and ensures that all are able to enjoy the peace of Celestia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who achieved greatness in their lives are encouraged to attempt the climb up the mountain, at the top of which is the Shining Palace of Alohim. The climb involves a series of trials that measure the enlightenment of the individual. Should the person undertaking the journey fail, they may climb forever without reaching the top, but for the truly enlightened, the journey passes nearly instantaneously, as they ascend the final steps to bask in Alohim's light and share in his rulership of the cosmos.

    <h4>Nephelheim</h4>
    <p><strong>Home of: </strong> Annam, Trolka</p>
    <p>
      The home of the Giant Gods, Nephelheim is surprisingly varied in its appearance across its face. Most of it is a cold, frozen tundra where the sun does not shine, but with pockets of cold marshlands and dotted with fiery volcanoes. Cities filled with the souls of giants, trolls, and giant kin dot the landscape as well. In this place the Ordning is the absolute law, and everyone and everything knows its place in the heirarchy of strength.

    <h4>Sanguinus</h4>
    <p><strong>Home of: </strong> Vrasja, Odio</p>
    <p>
      The realm of blood, ruled by Vrasja and her daughter Odio. This realm is dominated by creatures bent on murder and hatred, both of mortals, and each other. Unlike many of the dark gods, Vrasja and Odio have never sought to expand their influence, but instead take great delight in twisting the minds of mortals against each other, and thus drawing more murderous, hateful souls into their grasp. Their shared palace is dominated by a great arena, where their latest aquisitions battle in brutal blood sport. However, death on this plane is not release, rather those who die here are reborn, their minds slowly becoming more and more dominated by hatred and a lust for blood, until each continually craves their next chance in the arena so that they can wreak havoc once again.

    <h4>Demiplanes</h4>
    <p>
      Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.
