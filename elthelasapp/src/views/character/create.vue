            Character Creation is your first step into the world of Elthelas, and it is a relatively simple process, with a few easy steps. The first thing to realize is that there is no wrong answer. The next thing to realize is that even at this early stage, this is a colaborative process. Work with your GM and fellow players to help you build a character that fits exactly what you want to be. So lets dive in!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Create a Concept</strong> Before you decide how your character will be put together mechanically, you need a concept. This part is pure creativity. Think about the world that your GM has provided. If you are using the Elthelas setting, peruse the lore around this site. Where is your character from? Who were their parents? Did they grow up rich? poor? How were they educated? Do they have friends? Enemies? How old are they? And most of all, what prompted them to become an adventurer?

            <strong>Step 2: ABC (Ancestry, Background, and Class)</strong> Look at the Ancestries, Backgrounds, and Classes listed on this site. For each, think about and choose the option that best matches your concept. There might be more than one that is a good fit, and that's fine! In that case go ahead and pick whichever one looks more fun for you to play. This is the point where you can open up the provided character builder and start marking down your choices. If your class of choice picks its subclass at level 1 (Cleric, Sorcerer, and Warlock do this) you should pick this right now as well.

            <strong>Step 4: Skills</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Equipment</strong> You receive some starting equipment from your background, some classes also will include starting equipment that is critical to functioning as a member of that class (such as Tinker's Tools for an Artificer, or a Spellbook for a Wizard). However, to generate the bulk of your starting equipment use the following list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select one suit of armor with which you are proficient that costs 300 gp or less. <router-link to="/ref/quick">See the Quick Reference Manual for details on options.</router-link>
                <ul>
                    <li>Light Armor: Leather Cuirass, Scale Cuirass, Leather Hauberk, Chain Cuirass.</li>
                    <li>Medium Armor: Leather Full Armor, Scale Hauberk, Chain Hauberk</li>
                    <li>Heavy Armor: Scale Full Armor, Chain Full Armor</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Select up to 3 weapons with which you are proficient. Again, <router-link to="/ref/quick">see the Quick Reference Manual for options.</router-link> If one of your weapons requires ammunition, take 50 units of basic, nonmagical ammunition for the weapon (such as bullets for a sling, darts for a blowgun, arrows for a longbow, or bolts for a light crossbow). If you are proficient with shields, you may select a wooden or steel shield in place of one weapon.</li> 
            <li>If you are proficient with one or more sets of tools, add one set of tools to your inventory that you are proficient with.</li>
            <li>If you are proficient with one or more instruments or gaming sets, add one instrument or gaming set you are proficient with.</li>
            <li>If your class can cast spells, one spellcasting focus appropriate for your class.</li>
            <li>Select one equipment pack from the following list:
                <ul>
                    <li>Burglar's Pack - Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin.
