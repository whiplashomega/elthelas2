		Welcome to Elthelas. Elthelas is a world of fantasy. It is full of strange creatures, wondrous places, dark evils, and grand adventures. In Elthelas Gods and magic are a part of day to day life.

		Compared to your average D&D setting, Elthelas is more civilized.  The world sits in a place like 14th-15th century Europe. While guns have yet to make their debut, gunpowder is in use by select groups. Nationalism is taking root.  Kings are able to enforce their will beyond the city or castle gates. Even the 'evil' races have started to settle down. The orcs have large cities and settlements that are part of a large decentralized empire. The civilized races have pushed the remaining races to the wild places on the edges of the world.  Gnolls, bugbears, and centaurs all fit into this category. For those who were not pushed, the civilized races subjugated them instead. Goblins, hobgoblins, and kobolds fit into this category.

		An increase in organized society also means that war is no longer an idle pastime for local lords.  Wars are now often massive decade spanning conflicts between alliances of kingdoms. In these wars thousands if not millions of lives hang in the balance.

		This more 'civilized' world also brings danger for would-be adventurers. Kings and rulers are less likely to appreciate those who skirt the edges of the law for the greater good. Many of the civilized nations have regulated the use of magic. The morally-gray schools such as enchantment in particular is heavy regulated. Even so, many rulers owe their thrones to alliances with the colleges of magic.  Magic can bring a significant martial advantage in battle. Rulers draw the ire of the colleges at great risk. A college backing a rebellion or pretender can mean the end of a dynasty. The high priests likewise For most the Gods are a proven fact, and their withdrawal a selfless act to save the world. The common folk see the high priests of their faiths as the voice of their chosen God, disobeyed at risk of both immediate mortal and eternal peril.

		The world of Elthelas was first conceived sometime around 1998. The game Baldur's Gate had just come out. Baldur's Gate introduced me and many of my friends to the world of Dungeons and Dragons for the first time. Role playing was a new and interesting concept. We didn't have access to source materials or rules so we had to create our own. The original game we played was a loose LARP with few rules, but then again, we were in 7th grade.
	</p>
  <p>
		After a couple of years we all moved on with our lives and stopped playing the game, but the world lived on in my head. In high school I wrote a short story and then a (bad) novel taking place in the setting.  The main characters of the book were the ones my friends and I had conceived of back in middle school. The original materials will likely never see the light of day.  Even so, I believe I still have the manuscript somewhere on my hard drive.
	</p>
	<p>
		I undertook to rework the source material in college. I also started a rewrite of the book.  I hoped to use my somewhat increased experience both in the genre and in writing to improve the work. The source material took a decent shape from this effort, but the rewrite never got past chapter 3.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was a couple years after college that I played my first game of actual Dungeons and Dragons. It was only a matter of time until I reworked the source material back into the format that had inspired it: a Dungeons and Dragons campaign setting. So far I have run 3 successful campaigns in the setting, and am running campaign number 4.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, I have built a suite of DM Tools.  These tools include a reference manual, an encounter runner, campaign write-ups, and a character builder. I use these tools during play, turning my browser window into an interactive	DM screen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please feel free to browse the site, and if you feel inspired to play a campaign with the material, go for it! Have fun! That is, after all, the whole point.
