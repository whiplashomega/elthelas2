      <p>
        This campaign starts with the players at level 3 and takes them all the way up to level 17 over the course of 14 chapters.
      </p>
      <h3>The State of the World</h3>
      <p><strong>Gerasalim is in Flames</strong>. The Fortress of Light has fallen, Strovenguard is an occupied city, Eastguard has been reduced to rubble, and Northport has been evacuated.  The last of the Gerasaline armies have retreated to the Sword Mountains, attacking the orc armies from caves and hidden strong points. </p>
      <p><strong>The Moon Elves are nearly extinct</strong>.  After 2 years of being hunted in their homeland their numbers have been reduced to a few thousand refugees who have fled into Eldoran, Curinor, and Gerasalim.</p>
      <p><strong>The Dwarves have retreated to their holds</strong>.  No major hold has ever fallen to a foreign invader, and the Dwarves have withdrawn their armies to wait out the crisis.</p>
      <p><strong>Eldoran is in civil war</strong>.  The sudden extinction of the royal line and the ascension of the relatively incompetent Derandel to the throne left a massive power vacuum that various local lords have risen to fill.  Only the Waelin region on continental Elathia still fights against the Orcs, now desperate for reinforcements as Orc armies march directly on their borders.</p>
      <p><strong>Kandor faces invasion</strong>.  The Orcs are now on the unfortified southern border of Kandor, sending raids north while they attempt to deal with the remaining Gerasaline armies.</p>
      <p><strong>Into this destruction Gerad Heartbren, last commander of the Black Wolf Irregulars, has put out one last desperate call for recruitment</strong>.  You have answered this call, for reasons of your own, and have travelled to the fortress of Cur’Estan in the woods of Kandor, where the he is gathering the forces that will make a last desperate stand against evil in Elathia.</p>
      <p><strong>Dormania has withdrawn from the Alliance</strong>. The ascension of Alexandra Ransomir as Dormana I, Empress of Dormania, brings new hope in the east, but her ascension is not uncontested. The slighted second place finisher, Manius Aquila, has raised his flag in rebellion, and the western duchies of Dormania have risen to support him. This has forced the new Empress to hold back the legions and fight a war on her own territory.</p>

    <div id="chapter1startingout">
      <h3>Starting Out</h3>
      <p>
        You will start as someone who, for whatever reason, has answered the call by Gerad Heartbren to gather at Cur'Estan to defeat the orcs.  You may be a true believer, a money-hungry opportunist, or a desparate refugee. You may be acting at the behest of a faction you belong to, or seeking revenge.  Whatever your reasons, you find yourself at the gates of the castle Cur'Estan, ready to wade into the fray of a war seemingly already lost.  You are the last great hope of Elthelas.
      </p>
      <h4>Building Your Character</h4>
      <p>
        Players should use the following guidelines for building their characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1: Pick a Race</strong> <router-link to="/options/races">Use the race list on this site.</router-link>  Note that known languages have been removed from racial entries, languages known will be determined later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 2: Determine Ability Scores</strong> You can choose between a 30 pt point buy (max 16) or roll 4d6 (pick 3) 6 times and then assign them to ability scores.  If you use a point buy, use the following table to determine the cost of any particular ability score (before racial adjustment):
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Score</th><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Cost</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>12</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 3: Choose a Class</strong> <router-link to="/options/class">Use the class list on this site.</router-link> If the class or subclass details are not listed on the site they are available in the Players Handbook or the D&D supplement book listed on the page.  If you do not have access to a copy of the particular book talk to your DM.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 4: Determine your background</strong> <router-link to="/options/backgrounds">You can use the background listing on the site.</router-link> Backgrounds can be custom built as well.  Talk to your DM if you would like to use a custom background.  Use the guidelines in the Player's Handbook for building any custom background.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 5: Choose your Faction</strong> Players for this campaign are encouraged to start as part of a major faction.  Maybe you have been a long-time member of said faction, or you may be a new member at the start of the game. PCs will receive additional orders (and potentially rewards) from faction leaders as part of each major mission.  The faction likely shows up in the characters backstory, and the characters ideals and goals should be closely aligned with the faction they join.  The organizations provide various benefits to players in their adventuring career as well as upholding certain ideals called tenets.  See the <router-link to="/ref/orgs">Organizations page</router-link> for details on the factions, and the list below for the organizations available as factions to join in this campaign. If none of the prebuilt factions interest you, work with your DM to build a new faction of which you are a part.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 6: Detailed Character History </strong> Flesh out your characters history in relation to the events of the world with your DM.  You need to answer a few important questions, make note of each answer, and provide a copy to your DM:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><router-link to="/geo">Where are they from?</router-link></li>
        <li>They are starting the campaign at level 3, which means they have some history and skill already.  What have they done in the past?</li>
        <li>Where were they before the start of the campaign?</li>
        <li>Do they have family or friends somewhere that they care about? Who are their parents? How has their family affected their life?</li>
        <li>If you are a member of a faction, how did you join it, what is your standing in that organization?</li>
        <li>Is your character heroic? Would they lay down their life or otherwise make sacrifices for the greater good or to save another?</li>
        <li>What are their immediate goals? Are you seeking wealth, fame, glory? Are you after something more specific? Why?</li>
        <li>Is your character religious? The existance of the Gods is rarely disputed in Elthelas, but not everyone care to worship. Do they? If so who? (and of course, why?)</li>
        <li>Is your character merciful? Unforgiving? Temperate? Regularly Drunk? Scholarly? What character traits do they have that shape how they approach problems?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While you are coming up with these answers, talk to the other players. Find ways to incorporate one or more of them into your backstory. Are you from the same town? Were you both wronged by a common enemy? Maybe you served together in the military, or aided eachother on a previous adventure! The possibilities are limitless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 7: Languages Known</strong> Determine what languages your character knows.  See the <router-link to="/options/languages">Languages page</router-link> for details on what and how many languages your character knows.  All PCs should know Imperial from some means, whether by being from a country that speaks it normally, or by getting it through a background, racial, or ability score based bonus language. <em>Imperial will be the lingua franca of the campaign, and not knowing it will be a major hindrance to your character.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 8: Level up Your Character</strong> Your character should be level 3 at the start of the campaign, so level up your character appropriately according to your chosen class. Multiclassing may be allowed with DM approval, for the rules of multiclassing, see the Player's Handbook.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 9: Choose your Equipment</strong> Ignore the equipment provided by your class.  In addition to the equipment provided by your background and potentially your faction, you start with 500 gp worth of equipment.  Players can use this to purchase armor, weapons, adventuring gear, mounts or common magic items (see the <router-link to="/ref/quick">Quick Reference Manual</router-link> for listings and prices).
      </p>
      <h4>Organizations Available for Players to Join</h4>

      </ul>
      <h4>Factions Discouraged because they have a limited interest</h4>
      <p>
        Being a part of one of the factions below may require additional work with your DM to develop your characters motivations and reason to be a part of the campaign.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alliance of 6 Nations - This faction currently has no leadership</li>
        <li>Morrind Brewers' Club - The Morrind are currently neutral in the war</li>
        <li>Order of the Cleansing Fire - They want to destroy the elites on both sides of the war</li>
        <li>Stormlords of Trimala - Most of the campaign will take place in landlocked areas, piracy is not a significant concern.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Factions not Available</h4>
      <p>
        There are a few factions that are not available to player characters for this campaign (listed below).  These factions are directly opposed to the mission of Cur'Estan.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Black Guards of Mat'raktha</li>
        <li>Dragon Cult</li>
        <li>Voidbringers</li>
      </ul>
        <h3 id="curestan">Cur'Estan</h3>
      <p class="row"><img src="https://elthelas-images.herokuapp.com/maps/cities/curestan.png" alt="Map of Cur'Estan" class="col-sm-12" id="curestanmap" /></p>
      <p>
        Cur'Estan was once the fortress capitol of an ancient minor Kandori king, destroyed by Dorman I and left as a ruin in the woods.  20 years ago the Black Wolf Irregulars rebuilt the central castle to serve as their headquarters, and over the twenty years since a small town has sprung up around the castle serving the needs of the castle.  Over the last year, as the orcs have ravaged Demal'Thor, and then moved into Gerasalim, refugees have slowly trickled into the town.  A refugee camp has sprung up on the outskirts, and after the evacuation of Northport, they greatly outnumber the original residents.
      </p>
      <p>The de facto ruler of Cur'Estan is General Gerad Heartbren of the Black Wolf Irregulars.  He commands the castle, and roughly 2000 soldiers, the last remains of the Black Wolf Irregulars forces.</p>
      <p>The massive castle, with it's 30 ft thick walls, and 100 ft tall keep towers over the town in the west.  It contains large storehouses, stables, smiths, and fletchers who supply the soldiers.</p>
      <p>
        The town itself is dominated by the large stone embassy buildings, one for each of the Alliance nations, Kandor, Gerasalim, Dormania, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran.  Today only the Kandori Embassy is occupied, the rest have been abandoned, with only a caretaker cleaning crew assigned by Gerad to keep them from falling into disrepair.  The streets of the town are winding and haphazard.  The town was built quickly, with no particular plan, as merchants and tradesmen gravitated towards the town to fill the needs of the castle garrison and soldiers stationed there. The area directly in front of the castle gate is kept clear except in the mornings, when the merchants from the town, farmers, and hunters from the surrounding area set up temporary stands to sell goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the south of the castle is the barracks of the Black Wolf Irregulars, approximately 1500 soldiers stay in the barracks (in addition to the 500 or so garrisoned in the castle).  The area west of the barracks is used as a training ground.
      </p>
      <p>To the south of the town is the refugee camp, which has grown to be somewhat of a tent city, housing more than 20000 refugees from Gerasalim, managed by a contingent of Amathera's Shield, about 50 strong, and any volunteers they can find.  The refugees are welcome in town, and occasionally one will have the funds to build a proper house in the town itself, the rest are housed in large tents in the camp, each housing as many as 50 people.</p>
      <p>
        The southeast, between the town and the refugee camp, sits the permament complex of the Lords of the Rising Dawn.  An order of knights and paladins headquartered in Kaland.  The order has approximately 1000 soldiers garrisoned here in 4 large barracks buildings.
      </p>
      <h3>Faction Details in Cur'Estan</h3>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/amathera'sshield">Amathera's Shield</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        Amathera's Shield as an organization is one of the most overworked but nevertheless persistent groups in Cur'Estan. Officially they are in charge of the local refugee camp as a non-combatant group supplying aid to the dispossessed, unofficially they are the wartime arm of the Church of Amathera. Locally they are led by Malia Demonslayer, a recent arrival who led the evacuation of Northport. She is a skilled wizard and diviner as well, who has spent significant time behind enemy lines and is a part of Gerad Heartbren's war council.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/artificer'sofmechanus">Artificer's of Mechanus</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Artificer's of Mechanus do not have an official presence in the city, but Margo, the local perveyor of magical gear, is known to be a high-ranking member.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/blacksun">Black Sun</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        No one publicly acknowledges that the international thieve's guild known as the Black Sun has taken an interest in the war effort, but Kyman Hexhammer has often been linked to the organization, even rumored to be one of it's leaders, and he sits on Gerad Heartbren's War Council as his spymaster.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/blackwolfirregulars">Black Wolf Irregulars</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Black Wolf Irregulars are the leading faction in Cur'Estan, the town revolves around the fact that it is their headquarters, and the fact that they are the only real force still trying to coordinate efforts against the orcs. Their leader is Gerad Heartbren, an elderly but still spry Moon Elf and the last living founding member of the organization. He was reknowned in his day as an adventurer and skilled spellsword before commanding armies.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/bloodbrothers">Blood Brothers</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Blood Brothers are a relatively minor group in Cur'Estan itself, but they have set up a small chapter house in town led by a retired Kandori captain named Bero Orcslayer. They often take contracts from the irregulars to deal with local troublemakers so that General Heartbren can focus on broader concerns.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/championsofcora">Champions of Cora</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Champions of Cora do not have chapter houses in the traditional sense and never have, but those who wish to serve as Champions of Cora in or near Cur'Estan can report to the local Cleric of Cora Rolf Schönbecker.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/dormanianimperialguard">Dormanian Imperial Guard</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        Dormania is still nominally part of the Alliance of 6 Nations, despite being unable to commit troops to the war effort, and the Empress has recently sent the Archduke (and legendary general) Theodore Gloryheart to act as her ambassador in Cur'Estan and to serve as an advisor to Gerad Heartbren. Members of the Dormanian Imperial Guard would report to him as the highest ranking representative of the Empress.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/guildofheroes">Guild of Heroes</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Guild of Heroes is in the process of openning a new chapter house in Cur'Estan, led by Allison Highwater, who was most recently the local guild master in Northport before the evacuation.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/internationalgrangemaster'salliance">International Grangemaster's Alliance</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The dense forests of eastern Kandor are not particularly kind to farmers, but nevertheless there are a number of homesteaders in the area who have formed a local grange and supply the town with food as best they can. The grangemaster is a local farmer named Winslow Fredericks.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/illustriousguildofmerchantsandfineartisans">Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Illustrious Guild controls trade into and out of Cur'Estan, and the vast majority of local merchants are members. The elected guild master is Kendrick O'Malley, a retired timber merchant who gave his business to his son so he could concentrate on his job with the guild.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/theinevitables">The Inevitables</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Inevitables have no official presence in Cur'Estan, however the reemergence of the Prince of Fiends makes clear that he is in violation of several of the Eternal Laws, and must suffer the consequences. Members would receive their orders from the actual Inevitables via sending.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/keepersofthegrove">Keepers of the Grove</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Keepers of the Grove do not have an official representative in Cur'Estan, members of the Keepers may confer with the local Archdruid, Aconi Willowbark, if they wish, but he is not a member of the Keepers. Rather they would receive their orders via sending from the Earthmother's Druidic Council in Gnarra.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/lordsoftherisingdawn">Lords of the Rising Dawn</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Lords of the Rising Dawn are one of the primary factions in Cur'Estan as well as Kandori politics in general. The local general is Duke James Lightbringer. Duke Lightbringer also acts as the official representative and ambassador of the King of Kandor, and serves on General Heartbren's War Council.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/makersoflegend">Makers of Legend</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Makers of Legend are officially represented in Cur'Estan by Haera Oelefros, a master bard and historian who is determined to write the definitive volumes of the war effort against the orcs, telling the story of how victory was snatched from the jaws of defeat.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/mastersofthedeepsong">Masters of the Deep Song</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Masters of the Deep Song must officially abide by the decision of the Curinor War Council to withdraw the dwarves from the war effort. Unofficially it is rumored that they have sent agents in disguise to Cur'Estan, hiding among the refugees.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/shepherdsoftheall-mother">Shepherds of the All-Mother</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        The Shepherds of the All-Mother do not have an official presence in town, and are considered an illegal organization, but cloaked persons have been seen performing the ceremony of sanctifying the dead after local funerals, and everyone knows if you want to get in contact with a Cleric of Nera, talk to the local undertaker, Gimble Beren.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/silverdragonknights">Silver Dragon Knights</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        While The Dragon Emperor is not officially part of the war against the orcs, he recently sent one of his most skilled diplomats to Cur'Estan. Farnor Spiketooth is officially there to observe and advise, but his rather large contingent of 'guards' have been seen training with the Black Wolf Irregulars.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/sylvan'srangers">Sylvan's Rangers</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        Sylvan's Rangers do not have chapter houses, but the highest ranking member in town is Vanriel Glamfara, once captain of the guard in Eastguard, then the de facto captain of the guard in Northport when it was evacutated.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/trollkinmercenarycorps">Trollkin Mercenary Corps</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        Butch Godtouched leads a local group of Trollkin Mercenaries whose contract was paid for by Empress Dormana. Called Godtouched because she has literally stood in the presence of Gods and come back to tell about it, Butch is a legend among the Trollkin.
      </p>
      <h4><router-link to="/ref/orgs/unionofwizard'scolleges">Union of Wizard's Colleges</router-link></h4>
      <p>
        Many of the faculty of the Wizard's College in Strovenguard have found refuge in Cur'Estan. The old Dean of Abjuration, Ryvitior Morin, has begun work on a school of wizardry in Cur'Estan, and is actively recruiting magi of all types and skill levels as both students and faculty.
