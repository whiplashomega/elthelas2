    <h2>The Calendar</h2>
    <p>
      The current calendar in use was developed by the Morrind Dwarves shortly after contact with the mainland dwarves was reestablished.  Counting years from first contact, YFC, the calendar
      spread among their many trading partners until it came into common use throughout the civilized world.  However, the original meaning of YFC has been corrupted over time, and it is now
      commonly believed (except for among the dwarves) to mean Years since First Civilization, counting the years since society reestablished itself and the first cities were built.  The current
      year is 1845.
    </p>
    <p>Each year has 365 days split into 12 30 day months and a five day new years celebration.  The months are named after various Gods and are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neradan</li>
      <li>Dorunor</li>
      <li>Trimalan</li>
      <li>Sylvanus</li>
      <li>Gaiana</li>
      <li>Alohiman</li>
      <li>Coranus</li>
      <li>Moltyr</li>
      <li>Saris</li>
      <li>Maridia</li>
      <li>Tockra</li>

    </ul>
