    <h2>The Forces of Magic</h2>
    <p>
      In our world we are familiar with the 4 fundamental forces.  The strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force.  These forces account for everything in our universe.  In the universe of Elthelas and D&amp;D there are additional forces that act on the universe, namely, the divine force, and the arcane force.
    </p>
    <h4>The Arcane Force</h4>
    <p>
      The arcane force is emitted by arcanum, a rare material that is in fact a unique subatomic particle that is attracted to itself, and reacts to intentionality (a manifestation of the divine force) by emitting forces of its own on standard matter.  Most of the universes arcanum is noninteractive, and forms a barrier between the many "planes" of existence.  It is theorized that in ancient days the Gods built these walls of Arcanum to create greater order in the universe by separating arcanum from ordinary matter, allowing the divine force to act without causing unpredictable side effects.  However, philosophers have postulated that this theory may have a fundamental flaw, as the large collection of divine force necessary to form a God would have created massive chain reactions in a universe where Arcanum was more evenly distributed, likely dispersing the divine force in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most accessible arcanum in the universe is found in crystal-like deposits.  Sometimes these deposits are buried in rock, sometimes they are free-floating, and on occasion they even fall from space.  Gravity appears to act on the deposits normally, but the other forces can have unpredictable results on a deposit of Arcanum.  Wizards have learned how to focus their divine soul to interact with arcanum deposits to produce predictable results, typically through a series of spoken chants and gestures, and sometimes by introducing other forms of matter that the arcane force can act on. The ability to produce increasingly powerful effects requires increasingly large deposits of arcanum (although it is not consumed in the process) however, repeated use of an arcanum crystal attracts free particles of arcanum, incrementally increasing the size of the crystal, and allowing more powerful magic to be cast with it (in game this is represented through a wizard or other arcane casters experience level).  Certain creatures and people have arcanum in their blood (such as dragons and sorcerers) this allows them to produce magical effects without an outside source of arcanum, but because they cannot inscribe on the arcanum, the number of effects they are able to produce is limited by the power of their divine spark. It is common practice among the bardic colleges to artificially infuse the blood with a small amount of arcanum so that the student can produce effects to dazzle and awe their audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Arcanum is self-attractive, events of massive magical significance can cause arcanum to congregate in a particular area. This leaves the area prone to strange occurrances. Occasionally some of the arcanum attracted leaks from the planar boundaries themselves, introducing new raw arcanum to the material plane, and a weak point into the boundary between worlds, often manifested as a portal or through the random passing back and forth of creatures between planes at that location.
    </p>
    <h4>The Divine Force</h4>
    <p>
      The divine force is the manifestation of life itself, and can be generative or destructive, manifested in positive and negative energy.  The divine force has a unique ability to interact with organic compounds, causing them to react in a predictable (though complex) manner.  Every living thing is endowed with a certain amount of divine force.  The Gods are beings endowed with massive amounts of divine force.  The divine force is self-replenishing with time, such that creatures that use the divine force to produce some effect are drained for a time, but gain it back.  The divine force can also be granted to others (with training) although this weakens the one who grants it slightly.  Most mortals would die if they gave away their divine force, however, Gods give it to their chosen clerics and paladins regularly.  Druids and rangers draw divine force in small amounts from living things around them in the world, such as plants and animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the negative and positive divine forces can be used to grant or destroy life, however they naturally repel one another. Further, it has been found that whether ones soul acts with the negative or positive force is determined by the sorts of things one does.  This has created the natural 'good', 'evil' dichotomy in the universe, as those who choose 'evil' acts emit a force that is naturally repulsive towards those who commit 'good' acts, however in most cases the force is too weak to act at any distance from the individual, and thus this repulsion is undetectable by normal means.
    </p>
    <h2>The Schools of Magic</h2>
    <h4>Abjuration</h4>
    <p>
      Abjuration is the use of the arcane or divine force to create barriers. This includes creating and restoring the barriers between the planes, which includes banishment effects.  Dispelling effects and anti-magic fields are fields that remove or dampen the effects of arcanum or the divine spark, usually by creating a barrier that emits the dampening force that moves outward.
    </p>
    <h4>Conjuration</h4>
    <p>
      Conjuration magic is the use of one of the forces to pierce the planar barriers and, usually, bring something across the gap. This can be anything from energy (such as in an orb of fire spell) to a living creature, to small amounts of divine force (such as in healing spells).
    </p>
    <h4>Divination</h4>
    <p>
      Divination magic is the use of the forces to transmit energy over great distances, the energy transmitted can usually only be very small, and thus it is typically used for observational purposes.
    </p>
    <h4>Enchantment</h4>
    <p>
      Enchantment is the use of the forces to manipulate the minds of others.  This is a delicate and difficult process, and often can only be done in broad strokes.  However, most good societies consider the use of enchantment magic on unwilling individuals to be a violation of personal freedom, and additionally it can leave lasting, and sometimes unpredictable, side effects.
    </p>
    <h4>Evocation</h4>
    <p>
      Evocation is the direct application of arcane or divine force, sometimes to create other energy effects, and sometimes to simply apply force directly.
    </p>
    <h4>Illusion</h4>
    <p>
      Illusion is the use of arcane or divine force to manipulate sound waves, light, and sometimes even smell.  It is a school that often requires a great deal of skill and finesse, but not necessarily a lot of power.
    </p>
    <h4>Necromancy</h4>
    <p>
      Necromancy is an attempt to transfer the divine force from one creature to another, to animate non-living creatures, or tap directly into the positive and negative energy planes.
    </p>
    <h4>Transmutation</h4>
    <p>
      Transmutation is the use of arcane or divine force to actively alter physical forms or infuse them with energy.  It is usually a temporary effect as it is very difficult to overcome a living objects morphic resonance (a manifestation of the divine force that remembers a natural form, this is why healing spells infuse a person with a small amount of additional divine force, it strengthens their morphic resonance allowing them to heal faster).
    </p>
    <h3>Rule Differences</h3>
    <p>
      Prepared Arcane Spells - Arcane casters that would prepare spells with a spell book in official D&amp;D rules instead carry with them a piece of arcanum crystal on which they have inscribed their known spells.  They prepare spells by communing with the arcanum crystal and creating resonances in the crystal that can be tapped later to cast the spell (usually through a keyword and gesture, but sometimes just one or the other, or sometimes also requiring a component of some sort).  Inscribing a spell onto the crystal does not cost anything besides the knowledge of how the spell works.  Although scrolls are very expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scrolls - scrolls are documents written with special ink that has been infused with arcanum crystal.  The act of casting the spell usually emits enough local energy to cause the paper to catch fire, thus making them impractical to reuse.  There are no divine scrolls, as divine force cannot be stored in ink or paper without powerful necromancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potions - potions are drinkable liquids that have been infused with arcanum crystal already resonating with a particular spell, or infused with organic matter (often something simple and harmless, like sugar) that has been blessed by a diety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wands - wands are pieces of wood or metal with a small amount of attuned arcanum crystal and a special crystal that draws in and stores ambient divine energy. By combining the two a magical effect can be produced without any input of divine energy by the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Wizards</h3>
    <p>
      Wizards don't have a spell book in the traditional sense, rather they keep an arcanum crystal (which can be integrated into other items
      such as a staff, wand, amulet, ring, or shield) that accumulates free arcanum over time.  Adding a new spell through means besides leveling
      up involves the purchase of arcanum dust, which is then attuned to the new spell by communing with the scroll, crystal, or other arcane
      caster from whom you are learning the spell.  This arcanum dust then fuses with ones existing arcanum crystal.  Only spells whose attuned
      arcanum lies near the surface of the crystal can be cast, meaning changing ones prepared spells involves communing with ones crystal to
      literally rearrange the structure of the crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      One's arcanum crystal, or whatever it is attached to, acts as your arcane focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attuned arcanum crystal glows faintly in colors related to the spells prepared. So a crystal of a wizard with all necromancy spells prepared
      may be a deep black, while one of an evoker might have a red spot for his fireball spell, a white one for his ice storm spell and so on.
    </p>
    <h3>Sorcerers and Bards</h3>
    <p>
      Sorcerers and Bards typically have arcanum crystal that flows through their blood, although some bards have it integrated in colorful ways
      on their instruments instead.  How it got there can vary, certain sorcerers simply inherit such casting ability from their mothers,
      when arcanum crosses the placental barrier, while others who are seeking sorcerous power simply inject themselves (or are injected) with suspended arcanum
      dust, a risky procedure that often kills the recipient.
    </p>
    <h3>Divine Casters</h3>
    <p>
      Divine casters do not use arcanum, but rather borrow divine force from powerful entities, be them Gods or nature itself.
