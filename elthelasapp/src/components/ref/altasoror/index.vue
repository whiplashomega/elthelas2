    <p>
      Welcome to the world of Altasoror, a world created for the Between Worlds campaign.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      It all began with the prophet. Thousands of years ago, the prophet Sorore (Sore - Or) walked upon the planet and taught the world and its people all there was to know. The prophet taught the world of the one true god, the great creator, who guides us all towards prosperity. The prophet traveled to all parts of the world and spread the Creator’s message. The prophet spoke of peace, of rules, of cooperation, of humanity itself. The prophet created the “Tenants of Order” which all should follow. The prophet also knew how to build society, from its government to its cities, to its farmland. The Creator gifted the prophet will all knowledge. Once the world was taught, the prophet left leaving only one thing behind.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In the city of Sornal, in the kingdom of Sesta, where the prophet was born. The prophet left behind a stone tablet, inscribed with dire warning of doom, and the world's potential salvation. A hero with silver hair will stop the world from falling to this darkness. Unfortunately, the exact wording of the warning is unknown, as the Sesta have betrayed the prophet’s will, and guard the tablet from those who would read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, the world has become more divided in its interpretation of the prophets tenants. Those born with silver hair are raised as potential saviors. Trained in sword and diplomacy, to protect against all possible threats which may destroy the world. But all have been false saviors, having died in their journey, or turning to corruption. The world continues waiting for the true hero, and the doom that comes with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have tried to expand upon the world’s knowledge are met with a horrid fate. Those to delve into magic are consumed by it, either killed or driven mad. Those who attempt to advance technology meet with similar results. The world has not evolved much since the prophet left. Innovation is stagnant, witchcraft is forbidden in all parts of the world, and inventors are despised, or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this world is mostly peaceful. No great evils threaten the world, and mythical beasts are just that, myth. Political discourse is mostly positive throughout the world, save for the barbaric Sesta, and the lawless lands of Astipan. It is exactly as the prophet foretold. Which makes the world even more cautious about the prophecy of doom that the Sesta are hiding.

The people that live here are a close knit community, focusing a lot on family and cooperation. Though they follow the teachings of soric, they aren’t especially religious. They live in moving tent colonies to avoid the most extreme weather of the lands. Most travelers to Frugua tend to stay, as the feeling of community and cooperation can’t truly be found elsewhere in the world. Trade is scarce, as they have little to give, and trips out into the desert are harsh for the unprepared. People of Frugua tend to be shorter, and more slender than other places in the world.

    <strong>Description:</strong> Ochal is the main source of farmland throughout the region. The land has spotted small towns of trade centers, but they are few and far between. There is no set leader, other than minor town leaders. As the central country, all other countries must go here for extra food for the winter. Even though it has little in the way of defenses, it makes offerings to all other countries in order to keep the peace.
 
    <h3>Chechniar</h3>
 
    <strong>Main Export:</strong> Luxury goods<br />
    <strong>Government:</strong> Theology<br />

    <strong>Description:</strong> Chechniar is the kingdom of wealth and prosperity. A land rich in money and religion. It is the central land for the religion of Soric. A far more “catholic” style religion, featuring a pope-like figure In the Sorom, who claims to be the voice of the prophet. In reality, this church is mostly corrupted by greed and wealth. The practices that made the kingdom rich have been exploited to make the rich richer. And having a religious figure as their leader, who is then appointed by a council of other religious figures, very little looks like it will change for the better.

    <h2>Altasoror Extra Info</h2>
    <h3>Characters of Note</h3>
    <h3>Altasoror Church Information</h3>
    
    <p>Nobody knows the prophet true name or appearance. Depictions only show a mysterious figure with the iconic mantle and the sword.</p>
    
    <p>AltaSoror’s calendar is 400 days in a year, with no months. Each 100 days represents the change of seasons. 1-100 is spring season, 101-200 is summer season, 201-300 is fall season, 301-400 is winter season. Years are referenced in AS – After Soror.</p>
    
    <p>Sorore – with an E, referenced the prophet directly. For all other uses, the E is dropped.</p>
    
    <p>Potential Saviors – Those born with silver hair, are expected to visit all the counties of the world during their journey. If they are born in a place without the structure to train them, Malthein will always take them in. The silver hair of savior is quite distinct, and no hair dye or magic has been able to replicate it’s appearance. Anyone who has seen a true silver haired savoir would easily be able to tell the difference.</p>
    
    <h3>Religions</h3>
    
    <p>There are only 3 religions in the world, described below.</p>
    
    <p>Sororism – The most common religion in Altasoror. It is a general worship of the creator and following the prophets will. There are no required church meetings, tithes or rituals.</p>
    
    <p>Soric -  A far more organized religion that Sororism. The soric church governs over Chechniar, and all it’s inhabitants are required to pay a monthly tithe to the church. There is a very set organizational hierarchy, with the Sorom being the religious and governmental leader of the country.</p>
    
    <p>Sornal – Only followed by the Sesta. They believed the teachings of the prophet would lead to the doom of the world. As such, they do everything in their power to disregard and work against the prophet’s will and those that would follow them.</p>
