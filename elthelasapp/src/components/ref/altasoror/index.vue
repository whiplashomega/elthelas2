          <p>
            Welcome to the world of Altasoror, a world created for the Between Worlds campaign.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            It all began with the prophet. Thousands of years ago, the prophet Sorore (Sore - Or) walked upon the planet and taught the world and its people all there was to know. The prophet taught the world of the one true god, the great creator, who guides us all towards prosperity. The prophet traveled to all parts of the world and spread the Creator’s message. The prophet spoke of peace, of rules, of cooperation, of humanity itself. The prophet created the “Tenants of Order” which all should follow. The prophet also knew how to build society, from its government to its cities, to its farmland. The Creator gifted the prophet will all knowledge. Once the world was taught, the prophet left leaving only one thing behind.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            In the city of Sornal, in the kingdom of Sesta, where the prophet was born. The prophet left behind a stone tablet, inscribed with dire warning of doom, and the world's potential salvation. A hero with silver hair will stop the world from falling to this darkness. Unfortunately, the exact wording of the warning is unknown, as the Sesta have betrayed the prophet’s will, and guard the tablet from those who would read it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, the world has become more divided in its interpretation of the prophets tenants. Those born with silver hair are raised as potential saviors. Trained in sword and diplomacy, to protect against all possible threats which may destroy the world. But all have been false saviors, having died in their journey, or turning to corruption. The world continues waiting for the true hero, and the doom that comes with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who have tried to expand upon the world’s knowledge are met with a horrid fate. Those to delve into magic are consumed by it, either killed or driven mad. Those who attempt to advance technology meet with similar results. The world has not evolved much since the prophet left. Innovation is stagnant, witchcraft is forbidden in all parts of the world, and inventors are despised, or worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this world is mostly peaceful. No great evils threaten the world, and mythical beasts are just that, myth. Political discourse is mostly positive throughout the world, save for the barbaric Sesta, and the lawless lands of Astipan. It is exactly as the prophet foretold. Which makes the world even more cautious about the prophecy of doom that the Sesta are hiding.

They live in moving tent colonies to avoid the most extreme weather of the lands. Most travelers to Frugua tend to stay, as the feeling of community and cooperation can’t truly be found elsewhere in the world.

There is no set leader, other than minor town leaders. As the central country, all other countries must go here for extra food for the winter.

          <strong>Main City:</strong> Venier<br />
          <strong>Iconic Item/Landmark:</strong> Mantle of the Prophet. A scarf that the Sorom wears, it was supposedly worn by the prophet.<br />
          <strong>Description:</strong> Chechniar is the kingdom of wealth and prosperity. A land rich in money and religion. It is the central land for the religion of Soric. A far more “catholic” style religion, featuring a pope-like figure In the Sorom, who claims to be the voice of the prophet. In reality, this church is mostly corrupted by greed and wealth. The practices that made the kingdom rich have been exploited to make the rich richer. And having a religious figure as their leader, who is then appointed by a council of other religious figures, very little looks like it will change for the better.

        <h3>Altasoror Church Information</h3>
        
        <p>Nobody knows the prophet true name or appearance. Depictions only show a mysterious figure with the iconic mantle and the sword.</p>
        
        <p>AltaSoror’s calendar is 400 days in a year, with no months. Each 100 days represents the change of seasons. 1-100 is spring season, 101-200 is summer season, 201-300 is fall season, 301-400 is winter season. Years are referenced in AS – After Soror.</p>
        
        <p>Sorore – with an E, referenced the prophet directly. For all other uses, the E is dropped.</p>
        
        <p>Potential Saviors – Those born with silver hair, are expected to visit all the counties of the world during their journey. If they are born in a place without the structure to train them, Malthein will always take them in. The silver hair of savior is quite distinct, and no hair dye or magic has been able to replicate it’s appearance. Anyone who has seen a true silver haired savoir would easily be able to tell the difference.</p>
        
        <h3>Religions</h3>
        
        <p>There are only 3 religions in the world, described below.</p>
        
        <p>Sororism – The most common religion in Altasoror. It is a general worship of the creator and following the prophets will. There are no required church meetings, tithes or rituals.</p>
        
        <p>Soric -  A far more organized religion that Sororism. The soric church governs over Chechniar, and all it’s inhabitants are required to pay a monthly tithe to the church. There is a very set organizational hierarchy, with the Sorom being the religious and governmental leader of the country.</p>
        
        <p>Sornal – Only followed by the Sesta. They believed the teachings of the prophet would lead to the doom of the world. As such, they do everything in their power to disregard and work against the prophet’s will and those that would follow them.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>
          I was born Martinus Cato to factory workers in Desadorel. My parents died in a fire when the factory they worked in burned down. The owner had locked all the doors to keep people working. No one escaped. I was 8 years old at the time, my little sister was 5. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We were dumped at an orphanage, where the woman in charge forced us to work sewing clothes 14 hours a day. We lived with that for a month before I woke my sister up in the middle of the night and we climbed out the window. We ran back to our old apartment building, but our door was locked. Old Krozuth, the drunk dwarf who lived next door was around though and took us in. We lived with him for 2 years. He wasn't much of a parent, but he made sure we were fed. He couldn't hold down a job though and got evicted. Krozuth took to begging, 
        </p>
        <p>
          My sister and I, now 10 and 7, took to pick-pocketing and burglary to survive. Pretty soon I got noticed, by the Black Suns. A local boss by the name of Galan Yeslar found us, offered us a job working for him. We give him a cut of our take, he gives us a roof to sleep under and food to eat. Fair enough right? We made a point to give some of what we stole to Krozuth too, the guy wasn't getting any younger, and he was dear to us. Galan put us up in a boarding house, claimed we were his cousin's kids or something. Anyway, the woman who ran the place, Amelia Veneziale, took care of us reasonably well, and the front was that any money we had was given to us by Galan. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in the Black Suns I never really did better than a street-level pickpocket or small-time thief. The one time I was offered a better job I got paired with this nasty fellow by the name of Malar Bloodtooth. We were supposed to hold up some rich guy on the street. He resisted, I didn't want to fight. Malar cut him down without a thought. I ran. Never got offered any better work after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I died suddenly at the age of 19 when I was doing some second-story work (or more accurately 10th story work) and bet my partner, Curia Luti, that I could make the jump from the roof of one building to the next. I'd always had a crush on Curia, and we'd been partners for a couple of years now. Making a prayer to whatever God would hear me, I attempted the jump and fell to my death. A stupid attempt to impress a girl. My last thoughts were of my sister. Who was going to take care of her now?
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Gods unable to decide on the rightful place for my soul, I found myself in Limbo, lost and wandering. Limbo is, not fun. There is no order there, so my mind can't make sense of anything. Everything is just an endless haze
        </p>
        <p>
          The fog of limbo lifts. Who knows how long I have wandered the endless plane of Limbo, my mind unable to focus properly. Though the cleared consciousness is great, I stand before the iconic image of death himself. The angel Azrael, cloaked black holding a scythe. His hood up. Only a void where his face should be. His voice is deep and slow. "Martinus Cato?" It asks. I attempt to speak but find I can't, so I only nod. "You have been chosen for a task most grave. An ancient relic requires your protection and understanding." I attempt to ask questions, but I still can't speak. "You are hereby offered a second chance at life, complete the task, and the life is yours for as long as it lasts," I note that he does not describe what happens if I fail. "Do you accept the terms?" I again try to ask questions, to find out anything else, but I still can't speak, and Death's face holds no emotions. Returning to that endless fog is not an option. I nod my head in agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          A black portal manifests behind Azrael. "Then step forth. Your task is to understand the relic and destroy all that would claim it from you. Follow the relic, it knows the way, but be wary of what it offers." With that, Death dissipates into nothing, leaving behind the portal. The fog of limbo begins closing in once again, so I make my way through. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, unexpectedly, is a very fancy hallway. Complete with trimmed wooden lining, a beautiful blue carpet, and some paintings along the wall. I attempt to make them out, but they blur as I look closer. Down the hallway is a wooden door, with a golden sign on it, in a language I do not recognize. I turn around and see only darkness the other way. I approach the door, but it is locked. I hear a voice on the other side. I lean in and listen close. It says only a singular word in an unfamiliar voice. "Learn". My vision fades in a flash of bright light, a black blob in front of me. Like a Rorschach blob. For a moment, I think it looks like a battle-ax, and at that moment, it becomes one, I reach out and take it. Intricately carved runes cover the black blade and handle. Holding it, it feels right, like it is a part of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wake up, pain spread across my body. I feel hunger and thirst like I have never felt before. My body is broken, literally, at least my wrist, and a leg may be fractured. Wherever I am, it is dark, and it reeks of garbage. I attempt to move, but I must have several fractures throughout my body, as my bones are stiff in place. I can barely breathe, my body is a mess, and most notable, there is a throbbing in the back of my skull where I can feel the congealed blood. The gods have played a cruel joke and given me a dead man's body.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, the area I am in lights up. My body begins to glow faintly, and all the wounds close in unison. My vision focuses, and I can see. I am still hungry and thirsty, but not to the point of death. With the clearing of the pain comes a clearing of my mind, and in it are the last thoughts of a dying man "Meet Bern at the Shark's Tail inn". I move and notice something in my grip, it's the battle-ax from my vision. I move to remove myself from wherever I am.  Fuck, I think, not exactly the second chance at life I thought this would be. Grabbing the ax by the handle I limp away from the scene. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am in some alley. It is nearing dark. I think to myself "What have you gotten yourself into Martinus?", but the name feels wrong. I think to myself a moment about my name. Agriel Osiris comes to mind. It feels right. Was it this person's name? I cannot help but think of myself as Agriel. I remember the dying man's last thoughts "Meet Bern at the Shark's Tail Inn". It seems to be all I have to go on for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking out into the main street I can't help but notice the stares. A small child watches me for a brief minute before running into her house. "Shit, I need a mirror, what do I even look like?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A voice comes from a nearby doorway. "Come inside, blessed one, away from the stares of the unbelievers." A woman is standing there, in a black silk dress that accentuates her curves, she is older than me but still quite beautiful. Warily, I follow her inside. She tells me her name is Rachele and she shows me my appearance in a mirror. My skin, so pale it glows. My irises are white flaked with black. The effect is, otherworldly. I can feel a strange energy inside, waiting to be released. Rachele worships Nera in secret even providing rites of death for the nearby villagers. What the hell have I gotten myself into? "Go to the Shark's Tail Inn, find Bern." She tells me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who the hell is Bern?" I ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not know. Go, it is your task." Some task, but at least it's something. Maybe I can find out where the hell I am from Bern.
