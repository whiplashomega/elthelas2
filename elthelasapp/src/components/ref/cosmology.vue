    <h2>Planar Cosmology</h2>
    <p>
      The Planes in Elthelas are geographically coexistent, but the actual matter making them up is separated by barriers of arcane force.  Thus, planes being adjacent is simply describing that there is only one barrier between them.  Since cutting through multiple planar barriers at once requires exponentially more energy, planar travel typically requires movement through adjacent  planes, usually the astral plane.
    </p>
    <h2>The Central Planes</h2>
    <p>
      The central planes are all transitive of one another, filling the same space, and with the right magic, it is possible to move from one of them to another at any location.  Many of them are strange reflections of the material.
    </p>
    <h3>Elthelas - The Material Plane</h3>
    <p>
      Planar Alignment: True Neutral
    </p>
    <p>
      The material plane sits at the confluence of the other planes, and exists as the primary creation.  The material plane behaves as one expects, obeying the standard laws of physics outside of magical intervention.  Gaian keeps her home on the material plane, the only God who is permitted by the rules of the Gods Agreement to manifest on the material plane physically, simply because she has no other home.  It is theorized that other material planes may exist, but their existence has never been confirmed.

    <h3>Ethereal Plane</h3>
    <p>
      Planar Alignment: True Neutral
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ethereal Plane is the closest shadow of the Material, with only the thinnest of barriers between them.  The barrier is such that when on the border of the ethereal plane, one can see into the material, but not the reverse.  See the Dungeon Master's Guide (p48-49) for a detailed description of the Ethereal Plane.

      <h3>Astral Plane</h3>
      <p>
        Planar Alignment: True Neutral
      </p>
      <p>
        The home of dreams and thoughts. See the Dungeon Master's Guide (p46-48) for a detailed description of the Astral Plane.
      </p>
      <h4>Aurumal, the City of Gold</h4>
      <p>
        Floating freely through the Astral Sea, lies the city of Aurumal, the home of Maris, the God of Trade.  The huge metropolis is the final resting place of the devotees of Maris.  From here interplanar ships travel all the known planes (as well as unknown)  seeking wealth through trade.  The goods they trade in run from the mundane, such as ore and timber, to the unimaginable, such  as selling the feeling one gets when completing good works to demonic junkies in the abyss.  Maris presides over all of it, smiling as his servants continue their noble work through life and death.

      <h3>Shadowfell</h3>
      <p>
        Planar Alignment: True Neutral
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a  dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black  vault with neither sun nor stars.  See the Dungeon Master's Guide (p51-52) for a detailed description of the Shadowfell.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Feywild</h3>
      <p>
        Planar Alignment: True Neutral
      </p>
      <p>
        The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a  realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing through groves and fields.  See the Dungeon Master's Guide (p49-50) for a detailed description of the Feywild.
      </p>
      <h4>The Fey Courts</h4>
      <p>
        Unlike what is described in the Dungeon Master's Guide, the Fey have many courts in the Feywild, each led by it's own queen or king  among the Fey.  Among them are the Blood Court, led by Sanguine, the Deep Court, led by Ara, the Sun Court, led by Firan, the Stone Court  led by Rune, and the Sky Court, led by Mist, however there are many more, each focused on a particular aspect of the natural world.  These Fey Kings and Queens then in turn pay some small allegiance to one or more of the Gods.  For example, Ara is at least peripherally a servant of Trimala.

      <h3>Dragon Eyrie</h3>
      <p>
        Planar Alignment: True Neutral
      </p>
      <p>
        The heaven of dragons, the Dragon Eyrie is a reflection of the Material Plane in stark landscapes, small peaks become massive mountains, damp areas, swamps, and dry plains become empty deserts.  Through all of this, dragons and their kin live and rule all of the land.  Humanoids of any type are only allowed as guests in the Dragon Eyrie, and if not in the presence of their sponsor are subject to death without remorse.  Within the Dragon Eyrie the chromatic and metallic dragons fight out their endless war for dominance between good and evil.  The Dragon Eyrie is the home of dragon's souls.  Dragons who die in the Dragon Eyrie return to life the next dawn, however they do not age within the Eyrie.  Similarly dragons in the material plane who die awaken in the Dragon Eyrie at dawn.  Dragons who have previously died in the material plane are unable to return to the Material Plane by means of normal planar travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        High atop the highest peak, in what would be Dragonhome on the Material Plane, is the massive palace of Bahamut, the Dragon God of Metallic Dragons.  Meanwhile, deep beneath the earth, at the mirror of Dal Okra, lies the palace of Tiamat, Dragon God of the  Chromatic Dragons.

    <h2>The Outlands</h2>
    <h3>Negative and Positive Energy Planes</h3>
    <p>
      Divine energy can be split into two forces, negative and positive energy.  These forces on their own can be used to produce magical effects, and are used by clerics for many purposes.  The combination of these energies into a precise mix is the source of consciousness and life.
    </p>
    <h4>Positive Energy Plane</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Negative Energy Plane</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>The Confluence</h4>
    <p>
      The point where the positive and negative energy planes come together is known as the confluence.  At this point sits an imposing palace of white and black stone, the home of the Goddess Nera.
