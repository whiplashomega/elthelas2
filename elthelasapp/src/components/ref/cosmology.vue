    <h2>Planar Cosmology</h2>
    <p>
      The Planes in Elthelas are geographically coexistent, but the actual matter making them up is separated by barriers of arcane force. Thus, planes being adjacent is simply describing that there is only one barrier between them. Since cutting through multiple planar barriers at once requires exponentially more energy, planar travel typically requires movement through adjacent planes.
    </p>
    <h3>The Planes of Creation</h3>
    <p>
      These are the planes derived from the essence of Gaian, the heart of creation. The geography of each of these planes is mirrored between them, the root of which is the Material, and all the others being reflections of that.

Logos is separated into 4 sections, at the center of which is the Confluence, An island on which Nera's palace sits. The four quadrants around it are the Negative Energy Sea, which flows from Necronus; the Positive Energy Sea, which flows from Celestia; The Plains of Stillness, containing the road to Mechanus, and The Seas of Chance, a chaotic realm that flows out from Mercuria.</p>

      The base of the mountain is dominated by the City of the Righteous, a place of kindness and giving that is the home of Amathera. There she travels from home to home, and ensures that all are able to enjoy the peace of Celestia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who achieved greatness in their lives are encouraged to attempt the climb up the mountain, at the top of which is the Shining Palace of Alohim. The climb involves a series of trials that measure the enlightenment of the individual. Should the person undertaking the journey fail, they may climb forever without reaching the top, but for the truly enlightened, the journey passes nearly instantaneously, as they ascend the final steps to bask in Alohim's light and share in his rulership of the cosmos.
