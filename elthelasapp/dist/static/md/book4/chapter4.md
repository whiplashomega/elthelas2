# Chapter 4: The Invaders and the Mad Wizard

The orc army that recently attacked Northport is now moving east into the sword mountains, where the Gerasaline army has been hiding.

## Preparation

### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders:

Our scouts report that the orc army is moving east into the Sword Mountains, likely hunting the Gerasaline army that continues to harrass them. I need you to find that army first, and act as our envoys to Queen Organa. I want to offer them safe haven and alliance if they can make it to Cur'Estan. To find the army, I suggest you find the gnomish wizard, Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim. Word is he is in the occupied city of Strovenguard. His skills as a diviner should help you find the queen.

#### General Heartbren's Special Orders:

Silver Head stands between the Dormanian armies and assistance with this war, held by a rebel Duke, however he is relatively weak, and we believe being blackmailed by Aquila. Stop there on your way there or back and find out what is keeping him loyal to Aquila. If you can turn him to our side the Dormanian empress can move a legion into position to help cover Queen Organa's retreat.

<!--**Amathera's Shield Orders:** It is the common people hiding in the mountains we are most concerned about, more than queens and armies. Thousands of those fleeing the orcs have reportedly taken refuge with Queen Organa's army in the mountains. Make sure those people make it out alive. -Malia Demonslayer

**Artificer's of Mechanus Orders:** I knew Jim once, before he went off his rocker. He used to specialize in transmutation in fact, but his mind was altered against his will. Make sure Jim makes it back to Cur'Estan, it would be nice to see him again. -Margo-->

#### Black Sun Orders:

While you are in Strovenguard, word is that Queen Organa left behind some great treasure hidden in the castle before the Orcs moved in that has never been found. Get into the castle and search for the treasure. Maybe that divining wizard can help you find it. There was a painting of Queen Organa's father that used to hang above her throne in the great hall. The orcs never found it, but it would have been too big to transport. Have the wizard scry on that, and then bring me the painting. The rest of the treasure is yours. -Kyman Hexhammer

<!--**Champions of Cora Orders:** Queen Organa is a good woman and will not abandon those of her people who have taken refuge in the mountains easily, nor would we want her to. Find a way to get all of them out of there. -Maya Scientalis

**Dormanian Imperial Guard Orders:** Silver Head stands between the Dormanian armies and assistance with this war, held by a rebel Duke, however he is relatively weak, and we believe being blackmailed by Aquila. Stop there on your way there or back and find out what is keeping him loyal to Aquila. If you can turn him to our side we can move a legion into position to help cover Queen Organa's retreat. -Ambassador Gloryheart

**Guild of Heroes Orders:** We have a contract on a mind flayer in the area of Silver Head, track it down and kill it. Bring back it's head as proof. -Allison Highwater

**International Grangemaster's Alliance Orders:** I'm afraid the grangemaster's alliance has little interest in mountains and mining towns. -Winslow Fredericks-->

#### Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans Orders:

Larissa (LP) Percival is in Silver Head right now and has requested assistance with an undisclosed issue. Find her, find out what the trouble is, and take care of it. -Kendrick O'mally

<!--**Keepers of the Grove Orders:** Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim's mind has been touched by an unnatural force, and through him it's influence continues to spread in the world. See that his life is ended, then see that his body is given the heroes burial it deserves. His God will shepherd his soul in the afterlife. -via sending-->

#### Lords of the Rising Dawn Orders:

The orcs have turned Strovenguard into an internment camp, and no orc there is more guilty of this crime than the Warlords placed in charge of the city, kill them. If you can, make it look like infighting among themselves. -Duke James Lightbringer

<!--**Maker's of Legend Orders:** Why are we having the Gerasaline armies retreat? They should be fighting to the last in dramatic fashion! Convince the Queen to face the orcs directly, and then write me an awesome song about it! -Haera Oelefros-->

#### Masters of the Deep Song Orders:

There is a group of dwarven prospectors up in the sword mountains whose presence may not be entirely legal by Gerasaline law. Make sure the army does not discover their presence unless their legal status is established first. -Ogrun Firebreath

#### Shepherds of the All-Mother Orders:

Queen Organa has long been a vocal opponent of the Neran Church. Take this wand of animate dead and find a way to prove to her that judicious use of the dead may just save the living in this wretched war. -Gimble Beren

#### Silver Dragon Knights Orders:

There is a group of frost giants in the mountains that recently attacked and wounded a silver dragon, crippling it. They are hunting for it's lair now, wipe out the giants before they find their target. -Farnor Spiketooth

<!--**Sylvan's Rangers Orders:** There is a small colony of frost giants in the peaks that has been raiding the mining villages. See if you can find a way to wipe them out. -Vanriel Glamfara

**Trollkin Mercenary Corps Orders:** Queen Organa has failed to pay her hired mercenaries for the past several months and now owes 20,000 gp in back pay. Extract payment from her, and if she won't pay, pass along to the mercenaries the order to return to Degak'Ta. -Drog Stonearm-->

### Transportation

General Heartbren has rented a helmet of teleportation circle from Margo, and gives the party the sigil sequences for three circles: His own, located in Cur'Estan castle, the one in the abandoned Temple of Maris in Strovenguard, and one in the Temple of Maris in Silver Head, in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. The helmet is usable once per day.

## Strovenguard

<img src='/images/maps/cities/strovenguard.png' class="col-sm-12" />

Strovenguard is an occupied city. The Orcs forced the queen to abandon her capitol a few months ago, and most of the cities population is now officially enslaved by one warlord or another. Three orc's have been assigned as overseers for the town, officially gaining 'Warlord' status as a result, and have partitioned the town into thirds. The alliance between the warlords is tenuous, and the sections operate mostly autonomously. Humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, or halflings who do not have a slave brand are considered outlaws by the orcs, and fair game for whomever can capture them.

### Major Locations in Strovenguard

#### 1\. Royal Palace of Gerasalim

The Royal Palace is in fact an imposing and sprawling fortress built at the conflux of the Ara river and Saria Lake. Once the poliitcal center for Gerasalim, it has been repurposed by the orcs as a staging base and military center.

#### 2\. Maris Island Fortress

Maris Island Fortress guards the road to the north and is in charge of enforcing tolls and taxation on the river mouth bridges and ships passing from the lake to the river.

#### 3\. River Docks and Warehouses

The River Docks extend away from Memorial Square in both directions along the riverfront and lake shore. A wide boardwalk separates the piers from the various warehouse buildings. The warehouses are now all used by the warlords to coordinate food supplies, both for the city, and to be shipped upriver to the army.

#### 4\. Temple of Maris

The Temple of Maris is abandoned and stripped of anything of value by the orcs, but the stone beds used by the priests, and the Teleportation Circle used as a system of revenue, remains. As the players leave the temple for the first time, there are a pair of orc guards tasked with searching for escaped slaves who are surprised by them. The Orcs, seeing the party is well armed, are willing to let them go on their way.

#### 5\. Beren Brewery

The last functioning brewery in Strovenguard after the invasion, it is being used to supply the local garrison with beer. Currently running at only a fraction of its normal capacity due to a lack of skilled labor.

#### 6\. Memorial Square

The area around the royal palace is a large paved square extending a quarter mile out from the palace on all sides, where traditionally a stand-up market took place every morning. Permanent structures were banned for defense reasons. Today the square is mostly empty except for the odd beggar, and orcs passing into and out of the palace. Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim, disguised as a beggar, spends his time in the square most days, where he plans his next daring plan to free slaves from the city.

#### 7\. North Town

This unfortified northern suburb of Strovenguard lies beyond the river and is currently officially abandoned. However it has become a haven for escaped slaves attempting to evade the orcs.

#### 8\. Old Town

The central Old Town district is the original city built by Dorman I. It is laid out in neat orderly rows of city blocks with designated green space every 4th block.

#### 9\. New Town: Military District

The Military District is dominated by what used to be living quarters for soldiers and officers, as well as people involved in trades and services specialized towards such customers.

#### 10\. New Town: Factory District

The eastern portion of New Town is dominated by manufacturies and artisans.

### Important People in Strovenguard

#### [Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim](/runner/jimjimmyjimjimjim)

Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim is in Strovenguard, and once in the city he is not hard to find. Every one in town knows of him because he spends every day just outside the gates of the palace ranting at anyone who passes by and generally making a nuisance of himself. He has so far avoided unwanted attention by the orcs, but no one is really sure how since the castle is their base of operations and presumably they pass by him constantly.

Jim started out his career as a transmuter, until he was touched by the otherworldly force known as Me (now the goddess Area). Her touch caused him to get visions of different places and times, often uncontrollably, but over time he has gained more control over the visions. Very few are aware that he is anything but a crazy old gnome.

Jim is not willing to help the party. He will rebuff them initially. In order to get him to help, the players can pursue a few strategies:

**Blackmail:** Jim is a wanted man by the orcs, (there are wanted posters with his face on it all over town). If the players threaten to turn him in he will relent to help.

**Bribery:** Jim is amenable to bribery. He is particularly interested in transmutation spell scrolls or wands (can be bought from Margo).

**Persuasion:** Jim sees himself as a protector of the material plane from otherworldly forces, and is amenable to arguments that he would be helping protect the world from extraplanar entities such as the Prince of Fiends.

If convinced to help, Jim will attempt to scry on what the players ask him to, but only 1 thing per day.

#### [Warlord Rol The Unsightly](/runner/roltheunsightly)

Rol the Unsightly is the Warlord in charge of the old city of Strovenguard, and thus has possession of the Queen's castle. He is a known drunkard, and is irritable at the innability to get the local breweries up and running properly. He has been taking out his anger on his subordinates.

Rol spends most of his time hiding out in his personal quarters in the Royal Palace, he is typically alone except when he wants to rail against one or more of his subordinates.

#### [Warlord Drorull Spine-Axe](/runner/drorullspineaxe)

Warlord Spine-Axe is in control of the new city, and thus the breweries. He has denied the other warlords access to the little beer that is produced, hording it for his own men. He is aware of Rol's drinking problem, and sees it as a way to slight his rival who managed to secure the superior acquisition of the old city.

Drorull stays in an old manor house in the city, where he regularly holds audience and keeps a direct hand in the affairs of the city.

#### [Warlord Zhuk the Miscreant](/runner/zhukthemiscreant)

Warlord Zhuk is in control of North Town, north of the Ara river, a very minor award considering most of the residents of North Town managed to flee before the orcs arrived, and thus he gained few slaves from the apportionment.

Zhuk is constantly paranoid that the other warlords will attack him or cut off food supplies to his men, and has forced his men onto half rations so that he can stockpile goods 'just in case'. He has also been building new fortifications around the previously unfortified North Town, dedicating every slave he does manage to capture to the task. His men have been running secret raids into the New City to try to steal slaves from Drorull Spine-Axe.

Zhuk has made his home at Maris Island Fortress, the only fortified portion of his territory, where he regularly surrounds himself with guards.

### Assassinate the Warlords

#### Rol the Unsightly

Rol is in the Royal Palace, for details on how to find and assassinate Rol the Unsightly see 'The Castle of the Queen'.

#### Zhuk the Miscreant

Zhuk is in Maris Island Fortress, where he surrounds himself with guards. Jim Jimmy Jim Jim Jim, if the party is stuck, will suggest pretending to be an emissary in order to get to him. Zhuk is desparate for allies, and will even entertain the thought of betraying the orc nation, if not particularly seriously. He will not, however, keep up his side of any deal he makes and will betray anyone who makes a deal with him at the first opportunity.

#### Maris Island Fortress

Maris Island Fortress has existed for some time as an enforcement location for tolls and taxes. It sits on an island at the mouth of the Ara River, with a fortified bridge going to either shore. When entering the castle from the city you enter via the south gate into room 1 below. When the players are attempting to learn about the fortress the following pieces of information are available:

* No one uses the south gate anymore, it's barely even guarded.
* Most of the servants go in and out via a servants entrance by the kitchens, the gate is kept locked though.
* The north gate is usually open, but is guarded pretty heavily.
* Zhuk is paranoid, and keeps his guards close.  Getting him alone is all but impossible.
* Zhuk is desparate for allies against the other warlords, especially since he betrayed his brother to get the position he has and no one trusts him anymore.

##### 1. The South Entryway

The South Entryway is not actively guarded on the inside, but Zhuk uses it for a display of power, the bodies of recently executed criminals have been put on display here, some with their heads on pikes, others chained to the wall. A hole in the cieling leads to room 5, where the guards keep watch. The gate is made of wood and kept locked with a heavy chain and padlock. The guards in the gatehouse above have the key.  The south door into the keep proper is trapped with a pressure plate that will cause a spray of fire to shoot out hitting targets within 15 feet of the door for 4d10 fire damage (DC 13 dex save for half).

##### a. Gatehouse Stairs.

These stairs lead up from the South Entryway into the related gatehouse.

##### 2. Kitchens.

The castle kitchens are regularly filled with servants and cooks bustling in and out, most of which are human or halfling slaves. The north door is a small servants entrance that is kept locked, but one of the servants will open it for those who know the passphrase: 'Bagel muffins'. Anyone on staff knows the pass phrase, including the slaves, and most can be bribed to give it up, or a sneaky character may be able to overhear it in use as the door is regularly used by servants bringing in supplies.

##### 3. Old Store Room.

This store room hasn't been used in some time. It is filled with barrels of long rotted fruit.

##### 4. Kitchen Pantry.

One of two pantries associated with the castle kitchens, the servants often use the corridor behind the pantry to sneak a nap.

##### 5. South Gatehouse.

Guarded by a Blade of Ilneval and 4 orc troopers, they try to avoid going downstairs if they can.

<p><strong><a href='/runner/orcbladeofilneval&orc&orc&orc&orc)' target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 6. Inner Trap Room.

Once a cloak room for visitors, Zhuk has converted this room into a deathtrap. The south door is locked, and shoots a magic missile at anyone who touches it for 2d10 force damage. Their is a 5 foot platform on the north end of the room, and another one at the south end. Between the two, the floor has been dug out and poisoned spikes placed at the bottom. A rope bridge has been set up between the two platforms that is intentionally built to collapse as soon as someone steps on it.

##### 7. Barracks.

This room is filled with beds for the various guards who live in the keep. Since Zhuk is paranoid and keeps as many of his guards as possible as close as possible, the room is packed with orc soldiers, 18 of them at the present time (all just average grunts). Most do not have weapons on them, rather their weapons are on weapon racks around the room (one on each wall). Several of them are playing dice, a few others sleeping, a couple of them eating dinner, etc.

##### 8. Great Hall.

Zhuk is typically in the Great Hall, with his 6 elite guards. All of the doors are kept locked and trapped, with disable switches from inside the hall. Anyone who attempts to pick the lock or break down a door gets sprayed with acid for 6d4 acid damage (DC 13 Dex save for half).

##### 9. Old Treasure Room.

This room (behind a secret door in the old store room) has not been discovered by the orcs. It used to be used to store the toll collections, and 5000 GP was left behind here when the fortress was abandoned.

##### 10. Kitchen Pantry 2.

The south kitchen pantry, where the rare and expensive ingredients are stored. The door is trapped and locked and only the head chef has the key. The trap is a simple arrow trap (+5 to hit, 1d8 damage). Inside are a number of rare alchemical ingredients worth 500 gp.

##### 11. Soldiers Dining Room.

An old eating room for the soldiers. Their are still a couple of tables with chairs, but the orcs don't use it.

##### 12. North gatehouse.

This room has 3 Elite Guards who make sure no one who isn't allowed enters the Great Hall.

<p><strong><a href="/runner/orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orceliteguard" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 13. Extended Barracks.

This room has been converted into additional barracks space, with sleeping pallets all around the room. It has 10 guards in it currently.

<p><strong><a href="/runner/orc&orc&orc&orc&orc&orc&orc&orc&orc&orc" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 14. Abandoned Courtyard.

This inner courtyard is no longer used.

##### 15. North Cloakroom.

This room is an unused cloakroom.

##### 16. Vault.

This room was once a bedroom for a minor functionary, Zhuk, not knowing where the original vault was, has converted it into a vault for collected tolls and taxes. It has 10,000 GP and 3 random uncommon magic items confiscated from captured slaves. The door has been replaced with a heavy iron vault door, however the frame is still made of wood and can be relatively easily broken out.

##### 17. Vault Guardroom.

This room is magically darkened, with 4 Red Fangs of Shargaas hiding in the darkness, waiting to strike at anyone who enters without permission.

<p><strong><a href="/runner/orcredfangofshargaas&orcredfangofshargaas&orcredfangofshargaas&orcredfangofshargaas" target="_blank">Run This Encounter</a></strong></p>

##### 18. Guard's Secret Room

This secret room used to be used as a hangout by guards in the know. There are empty kegs, card tables and some bare cupboards. The corpses of three guards who hid in here when the orcs attacked are huddled in the corner, having starved to death.

##### 19. Servant's Living Quarters

This large living space was used by the castle staff before the orc invasion. It has been converted into a general slave quarters by the orcs. The kitchen, dining tables, and bookshelves that were there originally still remain, but now there are makeshift beds scattered around the room as well.
<img src="/images/maps/dungeon/marisislandfortress.jpg" alt="" class="col-sm-12" />

##### 20, 24. Storage

These rooms are being used for storage of mundane goods.

##### 21, 25, 27, Servant's Quarters
These rooms are all slave quarters rooms. There are 15 total slaves throughout the slave quarters.

##### 23.

##### 26. Armoury

This room is the general armory for guards on duty on the walls. The nearby stairwell leads up to the roof, where 20 guards are on duty at all times: 2 blades of illneval, 4 elite guards, and 14 normal orc soldiers.

##### 28.

##### 29. Overseer's Room

This room is where the overseers for the castle slaves live.

## The Castle of the Queen

## The Frost Giants

## The Dwarven Prospectors

## The Queen's Army

#### Orc Scouts

The orc army has sent out many scouts to try and find where the army is staying. These scouting groups range from 4-8 orcs based on how likely they are to find the enemy. The scouts move stealthily and should roll stealth vs the players passive perception, or their check if they decide to make one. If the orcs go unnoticed they surprise the players and attempt to capture them for information.

The orc scouting party is made up of Red Fang's of Shargaas (see Volo's guide to monsters) riding on Giant Bats. They will employ magical darkness (which they and their bats can see through) combined with diving attack tactics. If a rider is killed it's mount will flee.

#### Fake camp sites

The Geraslim army has left fake campsites throughout the forest, the players are certainly going to find at least one on the way there. The camp looks like it was recently abandoned in haste, and have left behind boxes of supplies and food. However the army has set explosives in the closed boxes, poisoned the water and food, and set rope traps to drop rocks on intruders. These traps are meant for orc scouting groups, as the army does not know the players are looking for them.

An explosive box, if triggered, does 6d6 fire damage to anyone within a 15 ft radius (DC 13 dex save for half). A DC 13 thieve's tools check can disarm the triggering mechanism on a box without opening it, however exposing a box to open flame will cause it to explode anyway. The boxes contain crude gunpowder and a triggering mechanism that strikes a spark when a string is pulled upward.

The poisoned food is a DC 14 constitution save or be poisoned for 2d6 hours. The rope traps are at random locations around the camp, they are a DC 16 perception to see, and a DC 13 dex save to avoid if you step on the square. If they fail they are restrained by a net and then hit by a boulder for 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

#### Giant Ape Trap

The army came across a giant ape in their travels and decided it would make an excellent trap. They knocked it out and buried it underground a little, they left it magically asleep and put a still burning campfire above it. The campfire is easily noticed and meant for the orcs, but the players find it first. When the players walk towards the campfire their footsteps, if they are not stealthed enough, will wake up the giant ape, which will very dramatically burst out from underground, and perhaps knock players prone for the ape to smush.

#### Fake Orc Negotiator

The players stumble across a lone orc that is carrying a white flag of truce and softly playing a drum to be noticed. The orc is meant to be a negotiator for the Geraslims army’s surrender, but in reality the orc is only supposed to learn information about where the army is hiding. The Gerasalim army is too noble to slaughter a peaceful negotiator, and their position will be exposed if he manages to get in contact with the army. The players have to make a decision on how to handle the negotiator before he gets noticed by the army.

#### Finding the Hidden Camp

The Gerasalim army has made a deal with a group of pixies to keep them hidden. They have created a circle of stones that prevent normal creatures from finding the camp. The players need to have talked to jim jimmy jim jim to have a chance to find the place past the pixies magic. Any creature that enters the stone circle without permission finds it is impassible and raises and alarm for the pixies. (The stone circle is away from the view of the encampment so the players can only discuss with the pixies at this point.) The pixies are paranoid and not easily trusting. The pixies demand that one of the players be turned to stone if they wish to gain entry. The Pixies will mention that the stoned player will join their garden forever for the insults the players have bestowed on them, even if they didn’t really insult them. Play the pixies as paranoid and unable to reach any reasonable agreement, thinking the players are orcs in disguise. Ideally the players will be forced to fight the pixies to the death. If mentioned to the geraslim army commander he doesn’t mind as he hated the pixies anyways.
