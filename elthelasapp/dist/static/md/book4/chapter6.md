## Chapter 6: Halls of the Underking

Meeting the Dwarves

### The Town

The players arrive at one of the few towns in the dwarven kingdom that hasn’t been fully evacuated. Mostly hill Dwarves and non-dwarves. A disorganized community made of those that refused to enter the depths. Asking around town, the townsfolk can easily point them in the direction of the dwarven hold entrance, but they all say its pointless as it is unmanned and impassible. If they players do bother to venture there it a massive magically enchanted metal door that prevents teleport or any entry. And indeed it is unmanned, no one responds to their call.

If the players are more persistent with the townsfolk, (Bribes, kindness, maybe doing a sidequest, being formal), the townsfolk know of a secret entrance that is suppodely to only be for dwarves that change their mind and wish to join the rest of them underground (this is what they are told, and it isn’t true, but they believe it.) They also learn this information if they waste time at the big metal door by a passer-by.

This entrance is a trick devised by the dwarves to kill bands of orcs. They expect the townsfolk above to eventually be captured and tortured into giving away this info. There are a system of puzzles to make it look like a true test of “are you a dwarf”. But they also don’t want it to kill a dwarf that might actually wish to return.

The Puzzles

Piano - Behind a massive bolder, that only the strength of 10 dwarves could move (Cumulative DC 100 Str Check that some of the dwarves could help with). Lies a passage the leads down. Eventually they come to a lone piano. Next to the piano, drips water onto curved shapes that ring out a simple melody. Players must play the melody on the paino. If you need an example, here is one from undertale that I like. Again the dwarves could help with this one if need be, but they will not continue past this point. Once played a wall opens to reveal the next area, the wall that opens is not the one directly next to the piano, making finding the opening ahead of time rather difficult. Players attempting to subvert the puzzles will not be treated nicely later on, as they are being monitored.

Musical Tunnels – At the entrance to this tunnel there is a sign that reads: “To any dwarf that wishes to return; steal your resolve. There will be no turning back beyond this point. If you have any unresolved business on the surface, now would be the time. To anyone else, know that only a slow death awaits you below.” This is the point where any dwarf allies leave, not wanting to truly leave the surface forever.

Ahead the tunnels are Marked with seemingly random letters. A through G (Not in order). They twist and separate and reconnect. It quickly becomes obvious that there is no exit. Even the passage that leads back to the piano is gone, almost as if it was never there. The do find In the center of this weave of marked tunnels a funnel-like tube that leads down, too small to even fit your hand in. Inscribed next to it is “The final note of our nations anthem”. Which a simple history check will let them remember that it is a grand crescendo with all the notes, though The C is flat, and the E is Sharp.

The tunnels hold any note sung in them for a bit of time. Singing any tune in the center of the tunnel makes the center ring out a note that is transcribed on the wall. Standing at the back of the cavern makes the note flat, and standing near the funnel makes it sharp. Though difficult, the puzzle could be completed with only one person running around singing all the notes. Again once all the notes are sung, a random wall reveals the next path.

History Lesson – As the players move deeper into the tunnels they come to an opening with a history based puzzle. There are 5 slabs with names on them placed around the room. And on the big metal door there are 5 slots that the slabs could be placed in. The 6 slots have descriptions of historal figures of the dwarves. This is basic dwarven history, but orc raiders wouldn’t possibly know it. Some examples below.

The name of our god – Dorun Forgesinger 
(The last name is a trick to throw people off, it can be a nickname that people refer to Dorun as.)

The first Dwarven King – (I don’t know this one,) Sikkoth Firebrand

The most famous dwarven builder – (Suggested names) Urmala Ashbender

The greatest champion of our god – Brehilda Leadarm

The most famous dwarven entrepreneur – Vagruth Axebraid

The most powerful dwarven mage - Ian Farbringer

A corpse also lies within the room, from a month or so ago, of an orcish spy that attempted to enter. A medicine check reveals that they died from poison. If the players enter all the slabs, but any of them are incorrect, the room quickly fills up with poison gas until they either die, solve the puzzle, or open the door some other way. Obviously, you cannot expect players to know these guys we just made up. But instead of having them roll history checks for each one (Though they can do that if all else fails). Have them instead describe how their player would know each one first. For instance, if a paladin describes their holy teaching of ancient heroes pf gods, they are far more likely to know of Brehilda Leadarm. A wizard that studied at a college would know of the deads of Ein Farbringer. A very good description allows them to automatically succeed on a roll. Try and have each player do one.

Poisoned Water – Ahead in the tunnels there is a small stream of water with a sign that reads “Those that drink deep of the gifts of Dorun shall persevere”. Drinking the water forces the player to make a Con save against poison. Anyone resistant to poison automatically passes this saving throw. Anyone else must make a save or become poisoned in a special way. They feel foggy and light headed.

Ahead of that area there is a small field of mushroom that must be passed. Anyone with a decent nature check can determine that these are known as “Caverns peace” mushroom. A very deadly and very rare mushroom that only grows deep in the underground. The mushrooms release toxic spores if disturbed, but they lose their toxicity in a day or so after being picked, so they do not make a good poison. Anyone that drank the water and did not fail can breathe the toxic spores without issues. Anyone that drank it and failed takes 8D8 poison damage (half on a successful Con save.) Anyone that didn’t drink the water takes 16D8 poison damage (half on a successful Con save.)

Statues – The final puzzle leads them to a very very bright room. The first thing they notice is that there is an orb affixed to a stone pedestal in the center of this room that is giving off a permanent daylight spell. Even the players find it annoyingly bright.
The exit door has a pedestal that could have something placed on top of it before it, and 3 red crystals imbedded in the door. It reads “Where all dwarves feel at home”. In the room are six statues of dwarves, each holding an outstretch stone item.

A warrior holds out a war hammer.
A Farmer holds out a shovel.
A Minor holds out a pickaxe.
A Merchant holds out a bag of gold.
A Cleric holds out a holy symbol of Dorun.
A Scholar holds out a book.

Whenever one of these items in placed on the pedestal one, a loud sound is made, one that clearly indicates incorrect, like a buzzer. And one of the lights on the door turns on. The trick is that none of these items answer the question properly. The real answer is that Dwarves feel at home in the dark underground. Players must cover up the daylight orb to reveal a glow-in-the-dark crystal plague in a recess in the wall. The plague reads “In the dark depths of the underground”. When placed on the pedestal it opens the door.

Final Chamber – The final chamber is a massive room, thing airplane hanger sized, with a massive sliding double door at the end with the inscription “Curin keep Stronghold Southern Gate”. One could easily fit an army in the room, or an invading force. There is also a small sign on the door that reads “please knock”. The trap that I mentioned is that this massive door does not lead to the city in the depths, it doesn’t lead anywhere. The players aren’t anywhere close to it in terms of depth at this point. The entire room is designed to collapse and crush an invading force that tries to force the gate open.

Knocking on the door has a dwarf wizard use Thaumaturgy to have his voice echo in the room. He will ask the usual questions, assuming the players can gain his trust, he dimension doors into the room. He tells players he can take them to the city, but they will not be allowed to leave, and they may be executed for trespassing, as the dwarves cannot risk the location, defenses, and strategy’s getting into the hands of the enemy. After answering any more questions he casts teleportation circle to take them into the city.

The Keep

 The players are lead from the teleportation circle, which is a heavily guarded secret, to Thornam Cavejaw, who is the one in charge of defense of the city. He is the wizards direct superior and the only one of the wizard can think of bringing them to. Thornam tells the players that the council probably will not listen to them. There is nothing they can offer to make them reconsider (Unless they actually have something that alludes to the Orcs plans, at the very least the dead orc spy had plans to use burrowing creatures).

Thornam is absolutely confident in the defense of the stronghold. The dwarves have set up tectonic sensors to sense any burrowing creature. And even if they got past that, the rock at this depth is so thick it takes specially trained creatures to burrow it, and even then, they usually give those creatures special equipment to do it. An orc army burrowing in would be easy to notice, and fighting the dwarves in small dark tunnels would only be a slaughter for the orcs anyways, as they have mastered this technique. The commander confidently says “There is absolutely no way any orc army could ever possibly get into this stronghold!” (It is very cliché to have the attack happen right as he says it, but I think it would be funnier if your pause for a little bit, then describe the commander being aware of the claim he just made, and nervously look around, before saying “See? I told you that nothing could possibly -”). Then the attack begins.

The Assault

A massive light fills the extreme dark of the depths, a single hovering point above the city. It slowly expands larger and larger until it is the size of a ship. The light dims enough to see a Nautiloid, an ship of the illithid, thought to be lost to time, floating above the city. The sides of the ship bears the colors and symbol of the prince of fiends. A lone mind flayer stand on the farthest platform of the ship, looking down upon the city, he wears a unique helmet with many eyes that are able to see in all directions. The ship continues to be surrounded be the bubble of the astral sea.

Orc soldiers begin pouring down dozens of ropes, using special hand grips that allow them to fall down a rope, and slow themselves before they reach the bottom. These grips are called sky grips, and you could perhaps have the players discover orc plans to have hundreds of these created, but for what purpose is unknown. The mind flyer above is giving out orders to the orc leaders below in the assault. So even though the orcs have just arrived, they fight and act like they know the city very well, able to predict dwarfs’ soldiers movements, able to set up mini-ambushes. The home field advantage of the dwarves is gone.

The ship continues to be in this bubble of the astral sea. Any ranged attacks that start from outside the bubble, lose all momentum once they enter it. Fireballs and arrows that attack the ship, stop in midair within the astral sea, as there are orcs still on the ship, whose sole job is to think the projectiles into stopping.

Once this starts going down, Thornam begins immediately relaying orders, completely ignoring the players. If they ask to help, he simply tells them to stay out of the way, as he believes they are somehow involved (Which they might be, the orcs needed to know the location of the stronghold in order to arrive there). If they persist, Thornam will order a rookie dwarf soldier to take them to the dungeons, then everyone except the rookie leaves. The rookie doesn’t care if they actually go to the dungeons or not, he just wants to not have to fight on his first day.

The players are left to their own devices on what to do. They can ask the rookie any questions they may have, but they will not be given any specific directions on what to do. If they flee, they may be lost in the tunnels for some time, and the dwarves might be defeated right here (Or the nautilod escapes at the very least.) The players are welcome to think of their own solutions to the problem, while not being given directions.

The main thing they must do if they are to stop the invasion is kill the mind flyer directing it. He alone maintains the orc strategy, he maintains the astral rift, and he controls the ship. With him dead, the whole thing comes crashing down. The nautiloid moves slowly through the city, dropping orcs into every street. The players can kinda predict the path of the ship, then attempt to find a building that will get them closer to it. Trying to use dimension door, or misty step to enter the bubble doesn’t work, as it is still within another dimension, though plane shift would work.

There are many ropes that are attached to the ship that the players could attempts to climb, though orcs would comes down the ropes to fight them. I think it would be rather interesting to have a combat encounter just on the ropes, as orcs attempt to cut the players ropes, swing down to meet them in combat, or maybe throw things at them from above (They don’t have arrows or oil prepared, as they figured people wouldn’t get this close to the ship.)

Once on the ship they can see a massive orc army within the astral sea. They enter the ship, the exit it to get into the stronghold. The mind flyer, and perhaps either some orc guards (boring) or some pet creature he has waits to fight the players. Most of the orcs on the ship are mooks, meant to kill peasants and sow chaos rather than an elite fighting force.

Once defeated the ship exits the astral sea, and is affected by gravity and comes crashing down on the city. The council easily sees they are not safe from the might and resources of the prince of fiends, and is willing to listen to the players and join the war.
