# Chapter 3: United Front

The orc army that recently attacked Northport is now moving east into the sword mountains, where the Gerasaline army has been hiding. Meanwhile, the Dormanian Duchy of Silver Head currently sides with Manius Aquila in his rebellion, preventing the Gerasaline armies retreat into Kandor, and the Dormanian legions from reaching the front. Find a way to flip the allegience of the Duke of Silver Head, and convince Queen Organa to join a united force based in Silver Head.

## Preparation

### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders:

Our scouts report that the orc army is moving east into the Sword Mountains, likely hunting the Gerasaline army that continues to harrass them. I need you to find that army first, and act as our envoys to Queen Organa. I want to offer them safe haven and alliance. Once you find the army, secure the city of Silver Head, currently under rebel control. We do not have the manpower or resources for an assault on the city, so you will have to find another way. Once you do, Empress Dormana has agreed to send several of her legions through the newly opened corridor to join in the war effort and protect the retreat of the Gerasaline Army.

#### General Heartbren's Special Orders:

Silver Head stands between the Dormanian armies and assistance with this war, held by a rebel Duke. I know Duke Silverbeard from battles years ago, he is a good man, and I believe Aquila must be controlling him in some way. Free the duke from this control, whatever it takes.

**Champions of Cora Orders:** Queen Organa is a good woman and will not abandon those of her people who have taken refuge in the mountains easily, nor would we want her to. Find a way to get all of them out of there. -Luna

**The Inevitables Orders:** We believe the Mind Flayer Calagus, fleeing the Marut, has taken up residence in Silver Head, disguising himself from discovery in some way. Find him, and show him the inevitability of his own death.

**Sylvan's Rangers Orders:** There is a small colony of frost giants in the peaks that has been raiding the mining villages. See if you can find a way to wipe them out. -Vanriel Glamfara

**Trollkin Mercenary Corps Orders:** Queen Organa has failed to pay her hired mercenaries for the past several months and now owes 20,000 gp in back pay. Extract payment from her, and if she won't pay, pass along to the mercenaries the order to return to Degak'Ta. -Drog Stonearm

**Union of Wizards Colleges:** A large group of students from the university in Strovenguard is believed to be hiding somewhere in the region. Bring them back to Cur'Estan safely.

### Transportation

General Heartbren has commissioned Margo to use Teleportation circle to get the party to Eisenferd.

## Eisenferd

Eisenferd is a small fortified city in the northwest of Gerasalim, so far ignored by the orcs because it lacks strategic importance and has been cut off from aiding in the war effort. Nevertheless, the arrival of the players sees the city under siege. The Temple of Maris they arrive in has become a temporary hospital. The temple is managed by Vera Eichwald, a well meaning if overworked Cleric of Maris. She is consistently out of spell slots, as she uses them all daily to heal the wounds of fallen soldiers and citizens. Hers is the smallest of the 3 temples in town, the other two being a Temple of Sara and a Temple of Cora. Vera was the junior cleric of the temple, but the senior cleric, her mother Heidi, was killed defending the city from an orcish assault two days previous. Since her mothers death there is no one in town with the knowledge and skill necessary to operate the Teleportation Circle in the temple.

### Important People in Eisenferd

**Vera Eichwald** The Cleric of Maris, and the first person to greet the party members when they come through the teleportation circle.

**Alwina Heitmann** The mayor of Eisenferd. She is responsible for organizing the citizens and the citizens militia in the city.

**Clara Moldenhauer** Commander of the 8th Regiment. She is in charge of the approximately 500 Gerasaline soldiers aiding in the defense of the walls.

**Joseph Strauss** Head Cleric of Sara, the most powerful cleric remaining in town (can cast 4th level spells). He expends most of his high level spell slots on creating food to supplement the limited supplies in town, and his lower level ones healing the wounded, along with his two remaining functionaries.

**Emily Scholl** the local Cleric of Cora. She has organized a group of devout and incredibly brave soldiers who move to the location of any assault.

**Samli Sorgen** Leader of the apprentice wizards who fled to Eisenferd.

**Kailu Azziri** Kailu was in the city hunting for magical artifacts stolen from the wizards college during the fall of Strovenguard.

**Warlord Cratus** Master of the advance orc army responsible for the conquest of Northport now seiging Eisenferd. He has a love of duels and personal combat, and won his position through strategic success in fighting his enemies personally.

### Assault on the Walls

Create the following initiative cards for this encounter:

Blades of Ilneval +0 (2 attacks, longsword, +5 to hit, 2d8+3 damage)
Claws of Luthic +0 (2 attacks (4 if less than half health), +4 to hit, 1d8+2 damage)
Orc +1

Shortly after the players arrive in town and have had a chance to meet a few of the more important people, the horns will blow in alarm and the streets will clear as a boulder from an orcish catapult levels a nearby house. Shouts can be heard from the south wall as well as the sounds of battle. If the players choose to intervene and help the defenders run the encounter as follows.

The players arrive at the wall to see orcs and humans fighting at the top, orcish siege ladders bring additional orcish forces to the top. Describe the scene as such:

You arrive to see the orcs appear to be more or less in control of this section of wall already, with only minimal resistence left, a dozen or so guards lie dead on the walls or having fallen to the bottom, only two remain fighting at the top of the wall. Emily Scholl stands with 2 guards on the stairs, fighting off several orcs attempting to descend into the town itself, another woman in heavy armor you don't recognize stands on the wall by herself, you watch as she swings her greatsword in a great arc, cleaving an orc in two. As you rush in a bolt of fire streaks down from above, landing amidst the orcs on the far side, a winged demonic looking fellow hovers above the battlefield. Several more orcs come climbing up onto the wall from the ladders that have been leaned against it, before one of them suddenly gasps in surprise, two shortswords protruding from its belly to reveal a halfling that had been hiding in the shadows, you catch only a glimpse of her before she has disappeared from view again. Another ladder crashes against the wall, another orc soldier jumping off ready to fight. There is a whistling sound followed by a loud crash before the house next to you caves in on itself, clearly impacted by something. Roll initiative. 

Split control of friendly NPCs between the players. There are 4 friendly NPCs

* Clara Moldenhauer, Fighter and Commander of the Guard
* Emily Scholl, Cleric of Cora
* Kailu Azziri, Bladesinger wizard
* Regina Underfoot, leader of the thieves guild, who volunteered to aid in the defense of the town. Officially she is a concerned citizen and a fruit merchant put out of business by the siege.
* there are 4 friendly soldiers left

There are 3 orcs per player character already on the wall (21-24). 2 of them are Blades of Ilneval, and 2 are Claws of Luthic. Total orcs in the assault force is 500.

[Stat Blocks for Orcs](/runner/orcbladeofilneval&orcclawofluthic&orc)

There should be one siege ladder for every player present, maximum 6, and at the end of every round each siege ladder will deposit an additional orc at the top of the walls, and a catapult shot will land in one random square, dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage and 2d10 fire damage (DC 12 dex save for half) to anyone in or adjacent to that square (15 ft cube). Among the orcs, for each 10 orcs there is 1 Blade of Ilneval and 1 Claw of Luthic. To maintain this, for each orc deposited roll a d10, on a 9 place a Claw of Luthic, on a 10, place a blade of Ilneval. Each round roll a d6, on a 5 or 6, the orcs attach another seige ladder to the walls.

End of Initiative Actions

* Catapult Shot
* Ladder Roll (1d6, new ladder on 5 or 6)
* New Orcs Arrive
* New Guards Arrive (new guard on 4, 5 or 6)
* Orc Morale check, roll a d20 + (number of living orcs - number of living friends), retreats on a result less than 10

Siege ladders can be pushed off with a DC 20 Strength Check, or destroyed. They are immune to piercing and poison damage, and resistant to cold, slashing and bludgeoning damage, have 30 hit points and an AC of 15. If the orcs are reduced to 3 siege ladders on the walls (or half the number of players, whichever is less) they will retreat.

After the battle, any NPCs not under Sydney's control will compliment the players skill in battle , thank them for their help, and escuse themselves to help cleaning up the wreckage. (if they are still alive) Whoever is alive but not under Sydney's control will suggest to Sydney's character that they accompany the party for a time and escort them through town.

### Offer to Negotiate

Shortly after the battle, a bedraggled slave will be released from the orc camp to deliver a message. The players will likely hear about it from anyone around them at the time. The orc warlord in charge, Cratus, offers to negotiate the terms of the cities surrender. His message: he will set up a diplomatic tent halfway between his army and the city the following day at noon. He will meet a delegation of the cities choice, no larger than 10 people, to meet his own delegation of 10 to negotiate the terms of surrender for the city.

If the players remain in town long enough for the negotiation to happen, and there is no deal on surrender, a second assault, this time in more ernest will occur. This second assault will dig under the walls instead of attempting to scale them, with trained bullettes breaking through followed by orc attack squads spreading out through the town.

The players will hear alarms coming from the city during the negotation followed by smoke coming from behind the walls. The warlord will respond that his assault team is currently burning all of the temples in the city. He is able to attack the city with impunity, and his soldiers will continue to slaughter the residents until surrender is agreed upon.

Should battle break out, Cratus's delegation consists of himself, one of his top lieutenants, a sorcerer, a cleric, 3 elite guards and 3 elite archers.

[The Delegation](/runner/warlordcratus&orcwarlord&orcbattlesorcerer&orcwarcleric&orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orceliteguard&orcelitearcher&orcelitearcher&orcelitearcher)

Cratus will not kill the players if he beats them in combat, but will stabilize them at 0 hp and leave, then use skywrite to leave a countdown in the sky, starting at 3 hours.

Frost Giants - The orcs have an uneasy alliance with the Frost Giants

Should the players negotiate the escape of the people of the city, or escape by other means, the orcs will harrass the escapees with Worg Riders (1 per player).

[Worg Riders](/runner/war-trainedworg&hobgoblinworgrider)

### The Apprentices

The apprentices are a group of 3 less than level 1 wizards, and one actual level 1 wizard. The lesser ones only know cantrips, each of them has learned one damaging cantrip and one other cantrip, Harry knows firebolt and message, Harvy knows shocking grasp and mending, and Houston knows ray of frost and dancing lights. The leader of the group and most experienced is Samli Sorgen, a level 1 wizard.

## The Queen's Army

#### Orc Scouts

The orc army has sent out many scouts to try and find where the army is staying. These scouting groups range from 4-8 orcs based on how likely they are to find the enemy. The scouts move stealthily and should roll stealth vs the players passive perception, or their check if they decide to make one. If the orcs go unnoticed they surprise the players and attempt to capture them for information.

The orc scouting party is made up of Red Fang's of Shargaas (see Volo's guide to monsters) riding on Giant Bats. They will employ magical darkness (which they and their bats can see through) combined with diving attack tactics. If a rider is killed it's mount will flee.

#### Fake camp sites

The Geraslim army has left fake campsites throughout the forest, the players are certainly going to find at least one on the way there. The camp looks like it was recently abandoned in haste, and have left behind boxes of supplies and food. However the army has set explosives in the closed boxes, poisoned the water and food, and set rope traps to drop rocks on intruders. These traps are meant for orc scouting groups, as the army does not know the players are looking for them.

An explosive box, if triggered, does 6d6 fire damage to anyone within a 15 ft radius (DC 13 dex save for half). A DC 13 thieve's tools check can disarm the triggering mechanism on a box without opening it, however exposing a box to open flame will cause it to explode anyway. The boxes contain crude gunpowder and a triggering mechanism that strikes a spark when a string is pulled upward.

The poisoned food is a DC 14 constitution save or be poisoned for 2d6 hours. The rope traps are at random locations around the camp, they are a DC 16 perception to see, and a DC 13 dex save to avoid if you step on the square. If they fail they are restrained by a net and then hit by a boulder for 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

#### Giant Ape Trap

The army came across a giant ape in their travels and decided it would make an excellent trap. They knocked it out and buried it underground a little, they left it magically asleep and put a still burning campfire above it. The campfire is easily noticed and meant for the orcs, but the players find it first. When the players walk towards the campfire their footsteps, if they are not stealthed enough, will wake up the giant ape, which will very dramatically burst out from underground, and perhaps knock players prone for the ape to smush.

#### Fake Orc Negotiator

The players stumble across a lone orc that is carrying a white flag of truce and softly playing a drum to be noticed. The orc is meant to be a negotiator for the Geraslims army’s surrender, but in reality the orc is only supposed to learn information about where the army is hiding. The Gerasalim army is too noble to slaughter a peaceful negotiator, and their position will be exposed if he manages to get in contact with the army. The players have to make a decision on how to handle the negotiator before he gets noticed by the army.

#### Finding the Hidden Camp

The Gerasalim army has made a deal with a group of pixies to keep them hidden. They have created a circle of stones that prevent normal creatures from finding the camp. The players need to have talked to jim jimmy jim jim to have a chance to find the place past the pixies magic. Any creature that enters the stone circle without permission finds it is impassible and raises and alarm for the pixies. (The stone circle is away from the view of the encampment so the players can only discuss with the pixies at this point.) The pixies are paranoid and not easily trusting. The pixies demand that one of the players be turned to stone if they wish to gain entry. The Pixies will mention that the stoned player will join their garden forever for the insults the players have bestowed on them, even if they didn’t really insult them. Play the pixies as paranoid and unable to reach any reasonable agreement, thinking the players are orcs in disguise. Ideally the players will be forced to fight the pixies to the death. If mentioned to the gerasalim army commander he doesn’t mind as he hated the pixies anyways.

## The Frost Giants

The Queen's Army is aware of the Frost Giants, but so far has been unable to triangulate their exact position, and since the attacks have been focused on a series of illegal Dwarven colonies, they haven't been overly concerned. They can point the party to some dwarf refugees who were from an attacked mine. The refugees can point the players to the mine, and note that the frost giants are probably trackable from there.

The frost giants numbers have been overstated by the distraught miners, a fact that can be easily discerned from the tracks by a decent tracker. The mine was attacked by only 2 giants, and it is less of a 'colony' and more a few outcasts causing trouble. There are 3 frost giants that need to be dealt with.

[Frost Giants](/runner/frostgiant&frostgiant&frostgiant)

## Silver Head

### Important People of Silver Head

**Shoppi Silverbeard** The leader of the local guild of merchants, Shoppi is strongly opposed to the Duke siding with Manius Aquila.

**Duke Julianus Cato** The duke of Silver Head, currently polymorphed into a goat. He vaguely remembers not being a goat, and recognizes the players as the sort of people who might help him return to his proper form.

**The Doppelganger Duke** The Doppelganger who is currently mimicking duke Julianus was hired by Manius Aquila to take his place, who also provided the scroll of True Polymorph used for the transformation. He has brought in devils from Manius Aquila's primary force to serve as an enforcer squad.

The city of Silver Head sits in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. It isn't a large city, but because of its strategic importance both as a funnel for valuable minerals and as a crossroads between 3 nations, it has been heavily fortified. Silver Head is the only majority gnome city of more than 1000 in Dormania, and while the duke himself is human, much of the power in the city rests with the gnomish silver merchants, in particular the head of the local branch of the Guild of Illustrious Merchants and Fine Artisans, Shoppi Silverbeard. Shoppi opposes the Dukes position in the civil war, as the city is blockaded from its most important trade routes and it hurts profits.

When the players first arrive in the city, Shoppi is leading a street protest of merchants and workers involved in the silver trade demanding the Duke switch sides. A captain representing the Duke will declare the protest an act of treason and send in thugs to kill protesters. The thugs are bearded devils.

During this scene a goat will begin following the party. The goat is the actual Duke, true polymorphed by the doppelganger who took his place.

#### The Duke of Silver Head

The Duke has been polymorphed into a goat, has all the intelligence and abilities of a goat, but vaguely remembers not being a goat.

#### The Doppelganger

A doppelganger working for Manius Aquila and the devils managed to replace the Duke of Silver Head.

## The Mind Flayer

Calagus the Mind Flayer is living in Silver Head, using illusion to disguise himself as an ordinary Blacksmith. He is well regarded by his friends, but for some reason no one can remember what he looks like. If found out he will plead for a reprieve, for although he successfully completed his ritual to achieve functional immortality, he otherwise breaks no laws, and has not yet lived out the natural lifespan of a mindflayer. He will attempt to fight and escape if a repreive is not granted.

[Calagus the Mind Flayer](/runner/calagusthemindflayer)

Players should level up to level 7 at the end of this chapter.
