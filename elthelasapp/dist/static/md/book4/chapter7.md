## Chapter 7: Waelin Independence

### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders

The new elven kingdom of Waelin is willing to aid the war effort where Eldoran is not. They have requested our aid in diplomatic matters in return. I am sending you to Loridesa in Eldoran. Your mission is to infiltrate the court and find a way to bring an end to the civil war that secures Waelin's independence and, ideally, brings Eldoran back into the war as well.

#### Black Wolf Irregulars

However much I hate to play Kingmaker, we cannot afford to have a weak king on the throne of Eldoran right now. King Darendel is a worthless and idiotic man obsessed with revenge against a man that no one has even heard of. Find a candidate among the noble houses in Loridesa and bring about a smooth succession as quickly as possible.

#### Inevitables Orders

Queen Nilofar of Eldoran violated the sanctity of reality to secure her place on the throne and must die for her crimes.

#### Sylvan's Rangers Orders

We need funding for our order, and Loridesa has long been one of our primary fund raising centers. As you work with the local lords, convince them to sponsor the Rangers, your mission is to rally enough pledges to amount to 10000 gp per month.

#### Union of Wizard's Colleges Orders

The elves keep many arcane secrets that they refuse to share with others. This may offend your sensibilities, but I have heard of a powerful book in the King's Library, the Tome of Clear Thought. I want you to steal that book so that we can study its secrets and share them with all the colleges of our order.

#### Black Sun Orders

#### Champions of Cora Orders

### The Noble Houses of Loridesa

#### House Se'la'mer

The House of Se'la'mer has held the throne of Eldoran (their name literally translates from Elvish to mean Lord of Elves) for as long as history has been recorded, however, their numbers have been reduced to almost nothing. King Darendel was a distant cousin of the previous king, but after a meteor struck a family reunion, he became the only remaining heir. Returning to take the throne after having been missing for more than a decade with a half-elf wife of unknown origin. As of now he remains childless, and should he die, House Se'la'mer would be officially extinct, likely leading to a succession crisis unless some other house could secure the support of their fellows.

#### House Vasandoral

House Vasandoral is currently the most powerful, and secretive, house in Loridesa. They aligned themselves with Queen Nilofar almost immediately upon the succession of King Darendel, and their members have been appointed to numerous government posts and councils as a result. The nominal leader of House Vasandoral is Navarre Vasandoral, a woman of incredible arcane skill who currently serves as both Archmage in Service of the King and head of the Wizard's College of Loridesa. Her husband, Keryth, ceded control of the house to his wife years ago and became a recluse. He has not been seen in public for years. In reality he has become a lich. Vasandoral has recently had a number of impressive financial windfalls, buying up armories and smithies throughout Eldoran in the weeks just before the civil war broke out, often for well below market value, and controlling a large number of plantations with army contracts. Nilofar introduced them to Grazz't with whom they gladly made a deal in return for wealth and power. Getting house Vasandoral's vote requires the removal of Navarre and Keryth.

#### House Woodthrall

House Veil used to be much more powerful, until High Lord Phanthos killed himself in disgrace and his older sons fled in shame. Now led by twin brothers Svarlt and Alfie Woodthrall, the brothers have spent countless resources attempting to discover the location of their lost sister, Eyvindra. With their resources depleted, they have little help they can give the party besides opening doors at other friendly houses, houses Miahana and Elamys, and their vote in councils.

#### House Miahana

House Miahana is led by Alanis Miahana, a woman who doesn't quite make it to 5 ft tall but nevertheless her presence fills whatever room she is in. She is a devout follower of Sylvan, and will gladly donate to the Rangers an amount between 500 - 4000 gp depending on persuasion roll. (1-10: 500, 11-15: 1000, 16-18: 1500, 19-20: 2000, 21-22: 2500, 23-24: 3000, 25-26: 3500, 27+: 4000). She is Eyvindra's aunt, the sister of her mother. She is displeased with King Darendel and could be convinced to take the throne with assurances that the other houses will unite behind her. She will support any other candidate the party puts forward if they do her a favor by convincing (by whatever means necessary) the kobolds working her silver mine to get back to work without the pay raise they've been demanding.

#### House Elamys

House Elamys is led by Luvon Elamys, an elderly but shrewed merchant who deals primarily in the export of spices and furs. He is uninterested in the throne, but will support the parties candidate should they track down a group of pirates who stole one of his ships and get his ship back. He could be convinced to make a small donation to the rangers, (persuasion 1-15: 0, 16-18: 500, 19+: 1000).

#### House Sylzana

Melandrach Sylzana, leader of Hosue Sylzana, is a suave young gentleman of ambition but little real power or wealth. He dreams of adventure and glorious battle against worthy enemies. He is uninterested in the crown, but will happily donate to the rangers (persuasion 1-10: 500, 11-15: 1000, 16+: 1500). He finds the civil war detestable, and regularly lobbies the council to just give Waelin the independence they desire so Eldoran can go back to fighting their real enemies, the orcs. If the party can convince him they have a plan with a good chance of ending the war, he will sign on to it, and ask to return with them to Cur'Estan so he can personally join the war effort as soon as possible. (Melandrach is a level 6 swashbuckler)

#### House Qinyarus
(subservient to Vasandoral)
House Qinyarus is led by Lyara Qinyarus, a stunningly beautiful young woman thrust into the spotlight by the sudden death of her parents just weeks ago. She herself has become a thrall to Keryth Vasandoral. Their are rumors swirling around her that she is involved in an affair with someone in House Vasandoral, because she is often seen going in and out of their house. She will refuse to entertain the party unless the domination is broken first. When freed she will be grateful and happily make a donation to the rangers of 3000 gp, but still has personal loyalty to Queen Nilofar. Should the Queen be out of the picture, she can be convinced to support certain candidates.

#### House Phidithas



#### House Ianberos



#### House Palar
