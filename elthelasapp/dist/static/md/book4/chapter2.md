# Chapter 2: Sealed

## Preparation

Vanriel will at the outset go to Eyvindra's house. She will ask her to continue to work with the team, and lets her know that Carver was seen at the local stables, where he purchased a horse and rode off to the east.

### Offers to Join

#### Sir Seig

Sir Seig will be approached by Butch Godtouched with an offer to join the Trollkin Mercenary Corps as a Special Liaison. If she accepts, the intelligence gathering orders will go to her, and the Black Wolf Irregulars will receive the alternate orders.

#### Eiko

Luna found Barbarious to be an unworthy companion, and his devotion incomplete, and forcibly unattuned from him. He dropped the blade and fled. Luna has concealed herself from view from all except those she thinks might be worthy, one of which is Eiko. Eiko will be walking along when she suddenly notices a sword sitting on the ground (rapier?). No one else seems to notice it, despite being conspicuously laying there in a public space. If she picks it up, it will talk to her, introduce itself, and ask if Eiko is willing to devote herself fighting evil in the name of Cora, and accept Cora into her heart. If so, Luna will instantly become attuned to Eiko, and give Eiko quests as a Champion of Cora.

#### Luna, the Sword of Cora, Initiate

Luna initially is a +1 Rapier.

***Light Eternal*** The holder of Luna can cast the light spell at will on Luna only.

***Fearless*** While attuned to and holding Luna you cannot be frightened.

### Important NPCs

#### James Gunn

The local blacksmith of Winterdrift and a spy for the Black Wolf Irregulars. He acts as a handler, gathering reports from agents throughout Kandor and sending them back to Cur'Estan. Unfortunately, the local guards intercepted one of the communications being sent to him that contained confidential information from the King's Court. He managed to evade them and is currently in hiding at a friends farm, Agatha Harris, just outside of town.

#### Agatha Harris

A local farmer who thinks the charges against her friend James Gunn are trumped up nonsense. She is an old widow and well respected in town, so when she refused to let the guards search her house to look for James, they went along with it rather than do something that would have the city council after them if he wasn't there.

#### Bimriel the Learned

Bimriel is an Ancient Silver Dragon, well known to live on Mount Frost. She has an extensive dungeon, and is known to horde books.

#### Bubbles

Bimriel's butler, Bubbles is an Iron Golem that through a mad experiment by his creator was given sentience. He now serves Bimriel faithfully as the head of her household.

### Orders

#### General Heartbren's Orders

The refugees from Northport managed to smuggle out artifacts that we must guarantee will not fall into the hands of the enemy. There have already been some shifty people around town asking about them, so I want to get them as far away and as well hidden as possible. I know of a hidden dungeon where I would like to seal these artifacts in northern Kandor. Travel to Mount Frost and find the lair of the Ancient Silver Dragon Bimriel. Get the Dragon to agree to guard the artifacts as a part of its horde.

#### Black Wolf Irregulars Orders

I need you to make a surreptitious pickup in the nearby town of Winterdrift. The local blacksmith is one of our covert agents, and will have a packet of intelligence reports we need you to retreive and bring back. Do not let anyone else see them, not even allies.

#### Trollkin Mercenary Corps Orders

The Trollkin maintain a strict stance on religion, no member of the Mercenary Corps shall publicly espose any religion, nor favor or oppose any contract based on relgion. However, there has been a recent underground movement where many Trollkin have begun to favor the Dark God Malik, drawing on his power to achieve greater success in combat. Recently a Trollkin squad under contract with the King of Kandor, went rogue, breaking contract and killing 10 of the King's men in the name of Malik. This sort of besmirching of the Corps reputation must not be allowed to stand. The rogue squad was tracked to the area of Winterdrift. Find them and kill them. Here's your payment for the job.

#### Champions of Cora Orders

Delving into your memories I see you have an unbeaten foe in the necromancer Xagnol. If you are to travel to your old homeland, find the cave where you once faced Xagnol, and discover what has become of the wretched creature.

#### Inevitables Orders

The Time Egg is a particularly noxious artifact, though the General and his fellows do not know it's full nature, it breaks the laws of time and must be destroyed. The Egg can be destroyed by subjecting it to extreme heat, but be cautious, it is a fragment of the will of Amathera, and her agents may attempt to stop you. -Quarut, Inevitable of Time

#### Sylvan's Rangers Orders

The Dragon uses some unusual creatures not seen elsewhere on the continent to defend his lair, we'd like you to capture one of these giant hairy creatures and bring it back to study.

#### Union of Wizard's College Orders

Bimriel, it is rumored, has recorded eons of history on the walls of her home. Please transcribe as much of this as you can.

### The Artifacts

The Artifacts have been locked in a warded chest that acts similarly to a bag of holding (technically holding the artifacts in a demi-plane). The warding on the chest is specially designed to prevent their influence from seeping into the material plane and to prevent them from being found by magical means. However, General Heartbren trusts the key to the chest to the party.

<!-- Time Egg -->
<aside>
  <h4>The Time Egg (wondrous item, legendary)</h4>
  <p>
    The Time Egg is a powerful artifact of Amathera, when the egg is held and the proper command word spoken, the user is brought back in time to wherever they were 24 hours 
    before, their memory intact of all that transpired during the previous iteration of that time. They then are able to relive that day, changing what they do, potentially
    undoing a catastrophic mistake, or intervening in an event that they previously had no way to foresee. Unfortunately the egg also has a horrible side effect preventing
    frivolous use.  After the 24 hours has elapsed, the mind of the user collapses on itself and they die instantly.
  </p>
</aside>
<!-- Barrier Crystal -->
<aside>
  <h4>The Barrier Crystal (wondrous item, legendary, attunement)</h4>
  <p>
    This crystal is a fragment of the Arcanum crystal that separates the material plane from the remainder of the multiverse, and is the combination of two barrier crystals.
    This crystal now serves the function of both of the two smaller crystals, and manipulating it connects one both to the abyss, and to the mysterious plane of the creature
    known as 'ME'. As soon as you touch the crystal, the entities beyond it become aware of you. The demons immediately use it to steal some of your lifeforce to open the
    briefest of portals to the material plane, causing a random demon to appear within 30 ft of you. This demon obeys your commands, so long as those commands serve the
    greater goals of its demonic lord, such as causing chaos, destruction, and murder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, when you touch the crystal the creature 'ME' attempts to take control of your mind. Make a DC 20 Charisma save. If you fail, you lose control of yourself, as
    if under the affects of dominate monster, however you do not get additional saves. If the remove curse or greater restoration spell is cast on you, you can attempt the
    save again. While under the affects of the crystal, you work tirelessly to serve the inscrutable interests of 'ME'.

<!-- Book of Vile Darkness -->
<aside>
  <h4>The Book of Vile Darkness</h4>
  <p>
    Anyone that attempts to read this book by proxy, such as scrying, using a familiar, using a mind controlled person, or any similar magic, will find the words to slip 
    away from their sight and be illegible. If a person willfully focuses and attempts to read the book, they must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw. On a success, they 
    realize the book is trying to influence their mind, but can still willfully read the book. On a failure, the person gains the flaw of “This book is the solution to 
    all my problems, to answer to my prayers, and I was destined to have it.”. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you finish reading the book, you become attuned to it. Once attuned, your alignment becomes evil, and must remain so to keep the knowledge and benefits of the 
    book. A person attuned to the book may not actively participate in an act of good, and must commit an evil act at least once every 10 days, or the book shall work to 
    find a worthier host.
  </p>
  <p>
    The book of vile darkness cannot be destroyed by any normal means. A good angelic being or deity which destroys the book causes the book to 
    disappear for 1d100 years, before the book reforms. If the book is lost and un-attuned it will subtly manipulate events to better increase the chances of it being 
    found. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The very presence of the book seems to seep evil into the surrounding area. The book causes plants to wither and die if near the book for more than 1 day.
  </p>
  <p>
    While attuned you gain the following benefits:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You increase either your intelligence or charisma by 4, to a max of 24.</li>
    <li>Your Wisdom decreases by 2, to a min of 6.</li>
    <li>A burn mark appears on the back of your left hand, marking you as the owner of the book. The mark is of Azreal, the angel of death, in the shape of a slice 
      cutting through a formless soul. You can reveal this mark to another intelligent evil creature to gain advantage on persuasion, deception or intimidation checks
      against them, as all evil creatures understand the marks importance, even if they do not understand its meaning.</li>
    <li>You lose any connection to any neutral or good divine/powerful beings. You must re-spec any levels of cleric or paladin to another available class, or take the 
      oath-breaker paladin class track.</li>
    <li>You can cast the following spells once a day each without material components and without expending a spell slot: Animate dead (at the 5th level), 
      Create undead, speak with dead, dance macabre, feign death, and harm. You use either Charisma or Intelligence as your casting modifier for these spells.</li>
    <li>You add the following spells to your list of known and prepared spells. The spells do not count against your number of prepared spells, and the spells are 
      forgotten if you unattuned from the book.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Toll of the Damned</strong> cantrip necromancy (V, S) Casting time: 1 action Duration: instant<br />
    You point at a creature that you can see and has the ability to hear sounds. The creature begins to hear a chorus of dolorous bells which fill the air around it for a 
    moment and beckon the creature to the afterlife. Constructs are immune. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is 
    missing more than half of its hitpoints, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage. The spells damage increases by one die when you reach 5 th level (2d8 or 2d12), 
    11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).
  </p>
  <p>
    Darkbolt 2nd level necromancy (V, S) Casting time: 1 action Duration: instant<br />
    This spell sends a surge of pure negative energy towards a target. Undead and constructs are immune. Make a spell attack roll against a target within 60ft that you
    can see. On hit, the target takes 5d6 necrotic damage and must make a constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.<br />
    At higher levels: The damage increases by 1d6 for every level above 2 nd that you cast this spell.
  </p>
  <p>
    You also learn to summon more powerful undead by channeling energy from the negative elemental plane directly.

### Travelling to Mount Frost

The party won't get far out of town before they are stopped on the road by a group that wants the artifacts in the chest. A hooded and cloaked wizard, backed up by several hulking undead, will demand they turn over the Book of Vile Darkness, in the name of Xagnol the Deatheater, or be killed where they stand.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/necromancer&ogrezombie&ogrezombie&minotaurskeleton&minotaurskeleton)

### Xagnol's Ancient Lair

Xagnol abandoned his old haunts ages ago, but the cave remains infested with undead to this day. The cave is not large, and is easily explored once the pack of ghouls that inhabits it is destroyed. Searching the cave can find:

* DC 5: Some petrified biscuits in a rotting cupboard.
* DC 10: Xagnol's old journal. The journal describes his quest for immortality, his discovery of the ritual to become a lich (though not details on what the ritual entails), as well as talks about the spell he created as a joke to use on adventurers who bother him that turns them into statuettes. He describes at the end of the journal how he has discovered that the sword Frostmourne, a key part of the ritual, is being stored at the Fortress of Cur'Mestin to the east.

### Intelligence Gathering

Winterdrift is not a very big town, it has one inn, a few shops, and lots of farmland. Prominently posted throughout the town are wanted posters for 'James Gunn, local blacksmith'. His shop is abandoned, and has clearly been ransacked.

James is hiding with a friend of his, Agatha Harris, who has a farm just outside of town. The documents they need were unfortunately at his shop in a hidden safe, and he is not sure if the guards found it or not. In fact the guards did find it, but were unable to open it. They carried it back to the local jail until they could find someone who could open it for them.

### Trollkin Rebels

The Trollkin who broke contract passed through Winterdrift shortly before the party arrives to the area. Interrogating locals reveals that they asked about where they could pick up a ship, and were reportedly travelling up to Port Frost to try to catch a ship.

The rebels are currently staying at 'The Lonely Sailor', a seedy inn and brothel in Port Frost that caters to sailors passing through Port Frost. There are 5 of them total, as well as the human Priest of Malik who convinced them to break contract. The priest will not engage the party directly, nor reveal his role in the whole thing until the Trollkin rebels are dead, at which point he will declare that Malik will have his revenge and flee.

### Destroying the Time Egg

Must be thrown into the volcano, Paladins of Amathera will try to prevent its destruction

### Mount Frost

***The Yetis*** Roughly half way up the mountain, the party sees a massive yeti running full speed towards them. It will not stop but will run right past them. Following the Abominable Yeti is a group of regular Yetis who are trying to chase it down and kill it. These Yetis will attack the party on sight.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/abominableyeti&yeti&yeti&yeti&yeti&yeti)

***Climbing the Mountain*** This encounter may happen when approaching the Dragon's lair or when attempting to reach the summit to destroy the time egg, whichever happens first. The mountain is steep, and perpetually covered in snow as a magical blizzard rages overhead. Climbing requires either slow progress with the use of climbing tools, or a DC 10 athletics check for each quarter mile attempted, with a failure resulting in no progress. It is exceptionally cold, and failure to wear appropriate winter gear causes a level of exhaustion for every 30 minutes spent in the snow, and resting while exposed to the blizzard is not possible unless special cold weather tents are used. While climbing the steep hillside a skilled perception check (DC 16) will notice that Winter Wolves have picked up the parties scent and are circling in for the kill. Failure to detect the circling wolves means the wolves jump out of the snow at the party.

***The Ritual*** As the party approaches the ice sheet wall that marks the entrance to the dungeon, they will see a group of 5 ice mephits sitting in a circle and chanting. The mephits do not seem to be responding to anyone, they do not seem to even notice the players, but Eyvindra will feel drawn to whatever ritual they are performing. If she approaches the Voice in her head will suddenly say 'Find Me at ' and then go silent. When it does, the ice mephits awaken from their trance, and seeing themselves outnumbered, will attempt to flee. A good Arcana or history roll will identify the ritual as a very primitive form of the spell Sending, advantageous because it requires almost impreceptibly small amounts of magical energy, but difficult to perform because it requires the sender and receiver to share blood, and to perform a lengthy ritual to send and receive the message.

***The Entrance*** The cave entrance is blocked by a massive sheet of ice, 50 ft tall.It does not reach all the way to the ceiling and is climbable but requires a DC 20 athletics check even from those with a climb speed, or the use of climbers tools (pitons, rope, and an ice pick).  Just in front of this is an extra large chest with a sign that says 'leave tribute here and I'll collect it when I get around to it -Bimriel'. On the other side of the blockade is a deep drift of loosely packed snow. It will break the fall of anyone falling from the top but the snow gets into clothes, and exposed areas and if it isn't dealt with within 1 minute the resulting cold causes one level of exhaustion. A small group of Yeti's guards the entrance past the ice sheet and will begin attacking anyone who makes it over. Beyond the Yeti's is a massive double door 20 ft tall and 20 ft wide, with a giant steel knocker. If the party uses the knocker the door will be answered by Bubbles (see below)

[Run This Encounter](/runner/yeti&yeti&yeti&yeti&yeti)

***The Greeting Hall*** The first room beyond the entrance is the Greeting Hall, where the sentient Iron Golem Bubbles, Bimriel's butler, will greet the party. Bubbles is not hostile to the party, but informs them that Bimriel does not guarantee free passage through his den to any, however friendly they may be, and if they have tribute to offer, the safest way for them to do so would be to leave it in the chest outside where it will be collected in a day or two or whenever Bimriel gets around to it. However, if they choose to deliver tribute to Bimriel directly, they will have to get through the dungeon. Bubbles reassures the party however, that so long as they do not steal from her, and do not attack the staff, Bimriel will not harm them and will certainly hear them out should they make it to her chamber.

***The Slide*** The door at the other end of the entrance hall opens to a steep icy slide that circles down into the bowels of the mountain. At intervals down the slide it sends the players into large snow banks, before continuing on. There are 4 snow banks in total, including one at the bottom.

***Hallway of Icicles*** Many small icicles jut out of the wall, none are sharp and they look non-threatening and decorative, but it is rather difficult to move through them without breaking any of the them. When enough break, or certain ones break, the stability of the ceiling falls apart and the player is covered in more snow slush.

***Fake Statue*** At the end of the Hallway of Icicles is an abrupt corner there is a statue of a noble adventurer, gazing in horror down the hallway which the players cannot see at this point. The players may believe there is a gorgon or a basilisk around the corner, but this is actually something the dragon asked to be made as tribute and isn’t even a real person. The trap part is that after the corner there is a pit of more slush snow, plainly visible, but do you dare look? Any player that tries to turn the corner while averting their eyes falls into the snow. Try to play up the basilisk possibly, specifically ask if the players are averting their gaze as they walk around the corner. Even if one falls in continue to ask if they avert their gaze. Further down the hallways they will find a plaque which dedicates the statue to the dragon, made as his request.

***The Portal*** The hallway with the fake statue leads into the portal room, where Bimriel has set up a permanent gate to the frozen portions of the plane of water near its border with the plane of air. This room is exceptionally cold, such that staying in it for more than a minute will begin to add levels of exhaustion, and it is guarded by creatures that have wandered through the portal, Ice Elementals and Ice Mephits. There are two doors out of this room, one to the right and one to the left. If the party doubles back into this room after going one way or the other, additional ice elementals and ice mephits may have wandered through the portal. Roll once on the table below for the first minute, and again for every 5 minutes after that, until there are 6 creatures in the room. The door to the left leads to the library while the door to the right leads to the staff quarters. The ice elementals will not attack the players unless they either attack first (the elementals particularly, they don't care about the mephits) or they approach the portal. The ice mephits will demand the players shoes in order to let them past, except Eyvindra, who they will call 'the Descended'.

***The Library*** The library is a massive chamber with bookshelves 30 ft tall (and no ladders). Books from every era have been collected here. There are two doors out of the library. One is heavily trapped and magically sealed, covered in runes, while the other looks like it was heavily trapped, before the dead frost giant in front of it tried to open it. It is however, jammed shut from the other side (DC 15 Strength check to force the door, the Frost Giants have placed a rock in front of the door to keep out intruders while they plan, their planning can relatively easily be heard through the door DC 8 Perception). The sealed door leads to the Great Library of the Stone Giants. The other door leads to the Gallery.

***The Gallery*** The gallery contains massive stone frieses filled with stories from Bimriel's life. Sitting in the gallery are 4 frost giants discussing how they are going to surprise the Dragon Bimriel and try to steal its horde. There is no way forward through the gallery.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/frostgiant&frostgiant&frostgiant&frostgiant)

***The Stories of the Gallery.*** Featured prominently are tales of the long dead kingdom of Asiro, the land of the Tabaxi, that once stood in the shadow of Mount Frost. When Bimriel was a much younger Dragon, he was good friends with several of the Tabaxi kings, and protected them from harm. It tells of the dances he attended and the songs he listened to, including lyrics to several. It also tells of the destruction of Asiro, Dorman's armies marching through the land in an all out assault, burning towns and slaughtering all who opposed them. At the end of the epic tale, Bimriel is fighting alongside his friend, the Tabaxi King, when the king is struck down by Dorman himself. Bimriel is injured, but spared by the Dormanian Emperor, and vows to never become involved in the wars of mortals again. 

***The Staff Quarters*** The Staff Quarters has a central hallway with many side rooms off of it, there are a number of silver kobolds passing through, sitting at tables, etc, as well as a few Yeti's who have been employed to help with the cleaning, and a golem or two doing some repetitive manual labor to cut out new rooms from the stone. Everyone is friendly to the players unless they attacked Bubbles, stole books from the library, or stole tribute from the tribute chest. In which case frontal assault on the room is likely to be suicide for the players. There are many diverging paths here, but only one leads out of the Staff Quarters and into the rest of the dungeon. Any of the staff can point the way.

***The Hall of Mirrors*** Players enter the room from the south, and see the complicated mirror puzzle before them. 

There are ice platforms (Blue squares) that allow the players to stand. The walls are smooth solid metal, climbing equipment does not pierce them. Below is rushing ice water. If a player falls in, they are swept quickly underwater, and out of the room to the south. They take bludgeoning damage, a level of exhaustion, and are spat out in a previous room.

Light comes from the ceiling and centers on mirrors (Orange triangles) which bounce the light in a straight line across the room. They can be rotated 360 degrees, but not up and down.

Green Crystals (Green stars) can have light shown on them. When they have light in them, they cause the corresponding thin ice bridge (Purple lines), with the same number to turn 90 degrees. If the light is broken, they turn back to their original position. If a player stands on the bridge while it is in motion they must make a dex save or falls off, as they are basically balancing beams. Players require no check to balance on the beams, as long as nothing moves or disturbs their crossing.

Big rocks (Grey pentagon), will block the light. They are very slick, and jumping onto them is quite difficult.

The center platform (Brown circle with line), also blocks light. There are 4 blue crystals (Blue stars), that, when they have light shown on them, lower the platform down from the ceiling. When all 4 are lit, the platform is lowered enough to be moved onto.

The two side doors have an extendable bridge (Pink Squares), so when one player makes it they can extend the bridge so others may enter. The extendable bridge requires a player to hold it in place, or it will retract.

The jist is, they need to shine 4 lights at the center area, and also shine two on the path that lead to the exit door in order to escape. The other two rooms need to have a player stand on the bridge as it turns in order to open the door.

***The Sanitarium*** Bimriel often takes in those who have been touched by madness from the surrounding communities. The Sanitarium is where she houses them. It currently houses 8 people who are too dangerous to be part of society. They are cared for by Bimriel's staff, and live in padded cells. When the party enters, kobolds in white coats are carrying an unconscious man into one of the cells, where they lay him in bed, shut and lock the door. They kobolds do not bother the party so long as they do not interfere with their work, and are willing to answer questions. Two of the patients are in the outer area, one sits in the corner hugging his knees and muttering to himself, while the other is sitting staring straight ahead, ignoring all around him. Upon seeing Eyvindra, the one in the corner will get up and run to her, trying to grab her arm. He tells her that she must get a message to Carver that he has been caught. Igor has been caught and Carver will have to continue on his own.

The orderlies, if asked about Igor, explain that they believe he went insane after finding some kind of strange, and presumably magical, stone while on a scouting mission in Malinval. They haven't been able to get details out of him, but he was committed after he was found wandering through Winterdrift accusing everyone of being out to get him.

***The Creche*** This large room is filled with piles of snow, and a silver wyrmling and a young silver dragon are napping in two piles of the same. There are 3 kobold attendants who do not attack the party, but refuse them entrance, as any risk to their charges (the children of Bimriel) is unacceptable. The children are named Qyvris and Corsas.

***The Ooze Room*** The Ooze room is 100 ft tall and long, and 20 ft wide, with a 10 ft by 10 ft door on each end, one leading to the Hall of Mirrors, and one leading into the Grand Hall. The door to the Grand Hall is locked (DC 18 thieves tools to unlock). On first entering the room it appears as if it becomes taller as one moves closer to the Grand Hall, but once the entrance has been cleared 1-2 White Maws fall from the ceiling above the entrance and attack the party, almost having the appearance of a cave-in.

[Run This Encounter](/runner/whitemaw&whitemaw)

***The Grand Hall*** The Grand Hall is where Bimriel entertains guests when she decides to. There are large tables (currently empty), staff on hand (all silver kobolds + Bubbles), and fireplaces with fires burning brightly. The room is pleasantly warm. Bubbles, who teleported down here to greet the party on their successful completion of the dungeon. Bubbles offers the players warm food and drink that, if accepted, will reduce any levels of exhaustion they have by one. The food is served by the Kobold waitstaff, who bring food in through a small side door that leads to the kitchens. There is a grand double door at the end of the Grand Hall that leads to Bimriel's personal quarters. Players are asked to leave behind all weapons, magical items that are not tribute for Bimriel (including Arcanum crystals, spellbooks, etc), with Bubbles before entering Bimriel's quarters and are each given a ring that they are asked to put on. These rings are Rings of Detection, they make the wearer visable to anyone within 500 ft, even through walls, magic etc, and require a remove curse spell to remove. Attempting to force their way in without the rings will lead to hostility from Bubbles and the kobold staff.

***Bimriel's Quarters*** Bimriel will greet the players in human form when they enter her quarters. She takes the appearance of an older, yet fit, woman, wearing a tasteful gown in an older style. Her quarters are a strange mix of massive and human sized accomodations, but everything is finely crafted stone. The room is cold, but not uncomfortably so.
