#### Start Date: 12th of Gaiana, 1846.

## Arrival at Cur Estan

<!-- Insert Personalized Arrival Stories based on character backstory and faction -->
#### Kismet

Kismet has come to Cur'Estan on mysterious orders to report to General Heartbren. 

On first arrival to Cur'Estan, Kismet will walk past a booth where a strange man is offering to tell people's fortunes. He calls out to Kismet, insisting that he must tell the fortune of the chosen one. He will draw tarot cards, as so...

1. 'Tower' (the card is clearly a picture of her monastary) - I see you have come from a dark fortress high in the mountains. This place holds great significance for you.

2. 'Judgement' (the card is a picture of an Inevitable) - You come to bring judgement to lawbreakers. A noble goal.

3. 'The Fool' (the card is a picture of Kismet being hit by a boot) - You will be hit by a boot to the head.

Immediately a boot lands on Kismet's head, and a voice calls down from above 'Sorry! was just airing out my boots and accidentally knocked one off the window sill, are you alright?'.

The fortune teller then teleports away, with a note sitting in his chair that simply states: "So long, and thanks for all the fish - Theri".

A messenger then stops Kismet in the street. "A message for you, uh, ma'am", and hands her a letter.

The letter states:

Kismet,

I have received word from your order giving rather specific instructions as to when you would arrive. It seems for the moment our goals align. I hope you do not mind working with others, as I am assembling a team of specialists that I would like you to join. Please join me in my office at the castle as soon as convenient.

General Gerad Heartbren

#### Ching Shu

Ching Shu has been offered a staff position at the College of Cur'Estan, unfortunately, right now the 'college' is just a couple of small buildings under construction right now, and the rest of the staff are a half-dozen old wizards from Strovenguard. Nevertheless anyone in town can point her to the construction site, and the new headmaster, Ryvitior Morin. Morin will tell her that he primarily has need of a field researcher to work with a team of specialists in ensuring the continued security of the town and the college, and sends her to meet General Heartbren.

She is stopped on the way by a gruff man with a long scar down his face. He glares at her, and simply says "Another one of you dirty wizards in town huh? well I'm watching you scum." Before walking off. Bystanders can identify the man as Fenrick Von Stoop, a member of the Blood Brothers.

#### Eyvindra Veil

##### Carver's Letter

Eyvindra,

I'm afraid the situation here grows desperate, and you must come to Cur'Estan at once. I cannot give you details as I do not know the allegiences of this messenger, but circumstances here are not what they seem, and I fear they watch me even as I write this. Find me at the Ranger's outpost inside the castle, once I meet you in person I will give you greater details. You must come, my life depends on you.

Carver

Carver however, was not at the Ranger's outpost. Eyvindra has checked in there every day since, but he was never there. A couple days ago a woman named Vanriel appeared and took charge of the Rangers, but she had never met Carver and could not give Eyvindra any information on his whereabouts.

##### Now

On the morning of the start of the campaign, Carver shows up at Eyvindra's little cottage in the woods. His beard is unkempt and grown out, his eyes look wild, his clothes are torn. He rants about everyone being after him, that everyone in town is an agent of the enemy. He hands Eyvindra a pinecone, claims it is they key to everything, but won't give anything specific, on any level of examiniation it is an ordinary pinecone. After a minute or two, he will accuse her of being a doppelganger, and run away scared. He refuses to answer any questions about Eyvindra's brothers.

Shortly afteward Vanriel will knock on the door and ask if Eyvindra had found Carver yet. Vanriel has come to recruit Eyvindra. She heard she has some skills in intelligence gathering, and she needs someone to handle the sticky jobs that require a smooth manipulator, and promises payment and a certain amount of discretion in methods. She will ask her to meet her at the castle to get her first mission.

#### Lilith and Var

Lilith and Var come to Cur'Estan separately, but soon run into each other. Outside the castle a recruiter is encouraging passers to join the Black Wolf Irregulars, with phrases like:

'Be a hero!'
'Impress your family!'
'Fight for the future of all the races!'

The recruiter will specifically call out Lilith and Var in hawker style, and ask them to join up. 'You look like impressive folk, just the kind the Black Wolf Irregulars need!'. After they sign the enlistment list, he will send them inside to see Leautenant Hammerfall who will test their combat skills. Tests include:

Archery shooting:

### Coming Together

When Var and Lilith finish the last trial in the courtyard, they will see Heara Oelefros in the courtyard attempting to recruit people for the Makers of Legend. The other party members will also arrive at the same time. She will point to a peasant who joined that morning, and have him do a complicated acrobatic tumble "with no training until this very day!" (+1 modifier, +1d4 guidance +1d12 bardic inspiration). "Join the Maker's of Legend and be a true hero! You (pointing to a random party member) you look weak and ineffectual, but you could be great! Come and face off against my new recruit at the skill challenge of your choice!"

After the skill challenge, Leautenant Hammerfall will point to the party members and inform them that General Heartbren is ready to see them. General Heartbren is waiting at the entrance to the castle.

#### The Council of War

**General Heartbren.** General Heartbren will have observed the challenge with a certain amusement. He will invite the party into his offices in the keep. He will take them to a large conference room where his inner council is gathering.

The war council is James Lightbringer, Theodore Gloryheart, Farnor Spiketooth, Haera Oelefros, Wyrmling Trapsmith, and Kyman Hexhammer. The party will arrive before any of the other council members except Ambassador Gloryheart, who General Heartbren will introduce as Theodore Gloryheart, Archduke of Falak, Ambassador of Empress Dormana I. Each of the others will be announced by the Seneschal in this order as such:

*   Duke James Lightbringer, Lord of the East Reach, Lord General of the Rising Dawn, Ambassador of the King of Kandor.
*   Dragon Lord Farnor Spiketooth, Retired Commander of the Western Legion, Special Ambassador of the Dragon Emperor Valraxa
*   Master Bard Haera Oelefros, Chronicler of the Great Histories. Professor Emeritus of History at the Kandori University of Art and Music, Minister of Propoganda for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Wyrmling Trapsmith, Quartermaster for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Kyman Hexhammer, Spymaster for the Black Wolf Irregulars
*   Malia Demonslayer, High Guardian of Amathera's Shield
*   Vanriel Glamfara, Scout Commander, Master Ranger of Sylvan's Rangers

Gerad will then lay out that each of them has been chosen to serve on a special group designed to bring together a wide range of expertise to deal with particularly thorny problems and missions involved in the war effort. First however, he wants to give them a chance to figure out how to work together as a group before giving them any truly difficult tasks.

<!--Insert Chapter 1 Mission Briefing-->
The influx of refugees here in Cur'Estan has left us with serious resource issues. I have a team attempting to deal with the long term problem of imports, but in the short term we are having trouble with our local sources as well. I would like you to deal with these problems. You can handle them in any order, but all of these are critical problems.

Our first and most important issue is food. A large caravan was supposed to arrive yesterday carrying grain and cooking oil, but we haven't heard from it. Find the caravan, figure out what is holding them up, and make sure they arrive safely.

The second issue we have is with the local Druids. We sent groups into the nearby forests to cut lumber so that we can build homes for the refugees, but they were attacked by groups of wild animals. I suspect the local druidic circle is attempting to prevent the town from expanding. However, these people have nowhere else to go and need homes. I need you to resolve this issue with the druids, one way or another.

The last issue is with a nearby mine. One of our merchants who regularly buys iron from them came back bloodied, and reported that her guards had all been killed by the kobolds who run the place. Find out what is going on out there. We've traded peacefully with those kobolds for years, so for this to happen when we need that iron the most is a big problem.

<!-- Individualized Faction Orders -->

### Faction Orders

<!--**Amathera's Shield** With tens of thousands of refugees to feed we need that food caravan here yesterday. We need you to prioritize that issue and get the food here by tomorrow.

**Artificer's of Mechanus** If there really is a dragon I'm sure it has some interesting devices in its horde, bring back any magical items you find in its horde for me to examine, I might even be able to improve them.

**Black Sun** I have heard rumors that the Druids are hiding a powerful staff, obtain it for me. I will make it worth your while.-->

**Black Wolf Irregulars** The Kobold tribe in charge of that mine has been friends with the town for a long while, try to find a way to handle this without too much violence. If the rumors of a Dragon are true feel free to dispose of the creature or just convince it to leave, but try to avoid killing any members of the tribe. -General Heartbren

<!--**Blood Brothers** We believe one of our own may have jepordized our contract to police the refugee camp. Look into the murder of Hilda Anschütz, one of the recently arrived refugees, if a Blood Brother killed her, we need to bring him in ourselves.

**Champions of Cora**

**Dormanian Imperial Guard**

**Guild of Heroes** Word is that there is a dragon in the area and a local merchant has offered a bounty for it's hide. I'm betting it has something to do with that kobold issue. Bring back the dragon's hide to get the bounty.

**International Grangemaster's Alliance** If we are going to feed all these people long term we don't just need houses in town, we need to clear forest for farm land throughout the area. Druids are nice and all, but we are talking about the well being of thousands of people, we cannot have the growth of Cur'Estan be constricted by treaties with Druids.

**Illustrious Guild of Merchants and Fine Artisans** That food caravan was a major investment by the guild, we will provide a bounty for every wagon that makes it here successfully.-->

**The Inevitables** Hilda Anschütz, a recently arrived refugee, was found dead in her tent this morning and no one is investigating. See Justice Done. -Zelekhut, Inevitable of Justice

<!--**Keepers of the Grove** The local druids are only doing their best to protect their land, make sure this issue is resolved without further bloodshed.

**Lords of the Rising Dawn** These attacks against the people of Cur'Estan must not go unpunished. Punitive measures must be taken against both the Druids and Kobolds, take them into custody if possible, kill them if you must.

**Makers of Legend**

**Masters of the Deep Song** There are dwarves among the refugees who would be glad to take over that iron mine and trade with the community, meanwhile these kobolds are guilty of murder. Drive them out of the mine and I will send good dwarven miners to take it over.

**Shepherds of the All-Mother** Lucretia the merchant has asked that the bodies of her guards be recovered. Recover the bodies from the kobolds and bring them back so that we can give them their funeral rites.

**Silver Dragon Knights** I suspect a chromatic dragon may be behind the kobolds sudden change of heart, if this is the case hunt down and kill that dragon.-->

**Sylvan's Rangers** Two of our scouts went out to guide that caravan into town yesterday, make sure they come back alive. -Vanriel Glamfara

<!--**Trollkin Mercenary Corps**-->

**Union of Wizard's Colleges** I believe the druids have acquired a magical staff that I would very much like to study. Please retreive it for our new college. - Ryvitior Morin
<!-- Mission Part 1 -->

## The Murder Investigation

Hilda Anschütz was a young sorceress of budding potential who was being groomed by Ryvitior Morin to join the new Wizard's College before suddenly turning up dead this morning. In her tent is a small journal with only one entry. The back of the tent has been ripped open as if by a dagger. Several of her personal effects have been destroyed (broken into small pieces),
and she has been hit by shrapnel. A close examination, however (DC 15 Medicine check), shows she died of strangulation. Their were no witnesses to the crime, the 2 people who share the small tent were outside working on breakfast at the communal firepit. They heard a loud noise but didn't think much of it (she's one of them mage types after all, who knows what spells she could have been working on), when they returned to bring her food a few minutes later she was dead on the floor. They reported it to the patrolling member of the Blood Brothers, a young wizard by the name of Isidorus Fronto who examined the crime scene briefly before leaving. Her chest has clearly been rifled through, with some loose clothes spilling out. Nothing of value remains inside. Other witnesses in the area saw Isidorus hanging about suspiciously near Hilda's tent earlier that morning.

Names of refugees who share tent:
Leopold Köstner
Stefanie Köstner

Text of Journal Entry:
I've just arrived in Cur'Estan and hopefully to a new life. I miss my family, but I think I've finally come to accept that nothing I can do will bring them back. I was exploring the town today, and met an old wizard named Ryvitior Morin who told me I had a lot of promise, and that he'd be happy to teach me about magic. It certainly would be nice to know why these strange things keep happening around me. He thinks I might be a sorcerer. I also met a nice boy by the name of Isidorus who was patrolling the camp. We talked for awhile, and I think he likes me, but I'm really not sure if he's my type. Apparently he's a wizard, showed me some of the spells he knows. One of them created a massive booming sound and threw me backward several feet! He apologized afterward, saying he didn't mean to hurt me, but I sent him packing after that.

## The Druid Problem

When the party is leaving to talk to the Druid's they will be stopped by a gold-skinned Dragonborn, [Satura Kalmuc](/runner/saturakalmuc), who asks if they know the location of the kobold mine of Queen Clara Eliana. She claims that her boss has a special reward for the Queen but hasn't been able to find her since they left Dormania (deception +10).

The Druids have been using a Staff of Mass Suggestion to convince the lumberjacks to give up on their work each day. They do not offer alternative solutions to the issue, but are amenable to reasonable ideas that address their concerns (deforestation, chasing away of wildlife). Should their concerns be addressed, they are willing, if asked, to sell the staff for a few thousand gold.

The Druid's leader is Aconi Willowbark

## Find the Caravan

The Caravan is about 10 miles out of town, somewhat near the mine. If the party follows the road out it is not hard to find their tracks where they went off road. The caravan is stopped because they cannot decide on a new caravan leader. The old leader was killed in a bandit attack and his two daughters have been fighting for two days over who should be the new caravan leader. The rest of the caravan members don't care, but also refuse to take charge because it was well known that the old leader wanted his daughters to inherit, he just never specified which one.

The caravan members did meet the scouts, Raimund and Markus, but they left to hunt for the bandits that had attacked them and they haven't seen them since. They can point out the direction that they left in. If the party follows their tracks they will find where they were ambushed and captured by the kobolds.

Dead Leader's name: Pepin

Daughter's Names: Auin & Adelhaid

While traveling near the caravan's location the bandit's may attack the party. (50% chance before, if not, then after). The bandits, if interrogated, do know where the caravan is, but do not know where the scouts are.

## The Kobold Mine

Gerad can point the party in the direction of the merchant, Lucretia Dorotheus.

#### The Cave Entrance

The cave entrance stands blocked by wooden blockades. A few kobolds in rough armor with crossbows and spears stand on stools behind the blockades. As soon as they see the players, one of them will burst run into the mines top speed, taking the first kobold tunnel. The rest of them won’t stand and fight either. After giving a brief warning to the players to leave from a distance, they will fire off a volley.  It is possible for the players to attempt negotiations here anyway. The kobolds may agree to take them to talk to the dragon. If the players continue approaching they will jump down. The last to leave will throw a torch on the deliberately oil soaked blockade, lighting it on fire. Meanwhile other kobolds will appear from kobold paths higher up the hill, poking their heads out and firing down on the players, before darting back into their tunnels. The upper tunnels are easily discoverable, but impassable by medium characters. Behind the barricade is a depression in the ground with a tiny hole leading to a pipe system. Once the players are past the barricade, it begins filling with acid.

[Run this Encounter](/runner/kobold&kobold&kobold&kobold)

#### Tunnels Part 1

The tunnels beyond consist of a single 10-foot wide, winding corridor, with railroad tracks. 20 ft in there is a kobold tunnel that goes to the left, and a mining cart filled with iron ore that nearly fills the passage. A medium character must squeeze on either side to get past the cart. Beyond the cart trip wires cross the corridor every 10-15 feet for the next 100 feet as the corridor winds around the corner and down a steep hill. By the second trip wire a crushed human corpse is visible from next to the cart. The body has been looted, but an intelligence check can identify it as one of the wagoneers who had previously been sent to retrieve ore from the mine. The trip wires do the following (in order):

1.	Razor wire. This firmly attached razor thin wire will cut at the ankles of anyone who doesn’t step carefully over it.
2.	Nothing, just trips the player.
3.	Causes a spider web to fall from the ceiling.
4.	Has been imbued with a faerie fire spell.
5.	Causes acid to spill from the ceiling above where the mining cart was, that then streams down the hill.
6.	Has been imbued with a grease spell that covers the floor of the hallway.
7.	 More Razor wire.
8.	Opens a pit trap beneath it. The cart will eventually fall into this, carrying any players it is dragging with it.

Once the third tripwire has been passed and the players are around the corner, they will hear a creaking sound as the mining cart gets pushed down after them. A side passage after the 4th trip wire goes up steeply to a dead end, but the wall at the end of that tunnel is an illusion behind which the kobolds have rigged a flamethrower that fills the tunnel. If players step into this passage to avoid the cart the kobolds will fill it with fire. 3 Kobolds with crossbows will open a trap door in the ceiling above the 6th trip wire once the players are underneath. They will drop a torch (lighting the grease if it was triggered) and fire a crossbow volley before closing their trap door again. If anyone falls into the pit trap, kobolds will rush in from their connecting kobold tunnels and try to stab them to death with spears.

#### Tunnels Part 2

Just beyond the pit trap another set of barricades has been set up, these ones made of piled up rocks. Players who come into sight will be pelted with bolts. If the players come within 30 ft, the kobolds on the barricade will retreat into their side tunnels just behind, except for one, who will commit suicide by bomb, lighting a barrel of gunpowder concealed behind the barricade on fire. The kobolds have additional arrow slits accessible from their small tunnels that open into the area behind the barricade from which they will try to continue to pelt the players with bolts. At the far end of the hallway, they have set up a ballista. The first player who crosses the barricade will be able to see it, with a kobold ready to flip the switch and send a giant bolt at him.

#### Tunnels Part 3

The tunnel veers sharply to the right after the ballista, beyond which there is a series of pit traps. The kobolds have made the first 10-foot pit trap obvious. However, the ground beyond that trap has been undermined so that anything heavier than a kobold who lands on it will cause the ground to collapse. If the players fall into the pit kobolds will run out from their tunnels at the far end to rain arrows on them. A third pit trap just beyond that one is filled with a gelatinous cube.

#### Tunnels Part 4

After the pit traps the players enter the working mines and living areas. This area is not trapped, and non-combatant members of the tribe (mostly children and the elderly) cower in side rooms. One of the kobolds in a side room will quietly invite the party in. He will offer to shelter them and help them rest and tell the other kobolds that the intruders fled. He tells the party that he was once the leader of the tribe, now displaced by the black dragon. He will ask the party to destroy the dragon, and offers to help with his old bodyguards.

#### The Dragon’s Lair

The black dragon sleeps in a pool of acid in a large chamber.  His small but significant horde sits in the corner of the room. Above the fight a cavernous vertical passage leads up and out to the sky, a network of massive spider webs blocking the path. If the fight is going poorly, the Dragon may breath up into this passage, melting the webs and sending the giant spiders down on the party. The spiders attack kobolds and party members alike indiscriminately, avoiding attacking only the dragon, who they fear instinctually.

A good diplomacy check if there are negotiations can convince the dragon that his position is untenable here, even should he kill the party, there are heroes in Cur'Estan who are stronger than he that will not stand by and let him terrorize the area. If successfully convinced he will ask to take his horde and a few servants from the tribe with him, but will otherwise agree to leave.

The kobold sorcerer is the old leader of the tribe, and he chafes at being forced to serve an evil dragon. He will turn on his master if the party has avoided killing kobolds up to now, and if he does so will the other kobolds.
