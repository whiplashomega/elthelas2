To use this ability, you must have tinker's tools or other artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:\n\n* The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\n* Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.\n* The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.\n* A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.\n\nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.\n\nYou can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies."},{"level":1,"name":"Spellcasting","description":"You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.\n\n#### Tools Required\n\nYou produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.\n\nAfter you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.\n\n#### Cantrips (0-Level Spells) At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.\n\nWhen you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n####Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared."},{"level":2,"name":"Infuse Item","description":"At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.\n\n#### Infusions Known\n\nWhen you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the \"Artificer Infusions\" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.\n\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.\n\n#### Infusing an Item\n\nWhenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see \"Attunement\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n\nYour infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.\n\nYou can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies."},{"level":3,"name":"Artificer Specialist","description":"At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed at the end of the class's description.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).\n\nWhile holding the object, a creÙÄéçture can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object."},{"level":14,"name":"Magic Item Savant","description":"At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:\n\n* You can attune to up to five magic items at once.\n* You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item."},{"level":18,"name":"Magic Item Master","description":"Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once."},{"level":20,"name":"Soul of Artifice","description":"At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:\n\n* You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.\n\n* If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0."}],"subclass":[{"name":"Alchemist","castermult":0.5,"features":[{"level":3,"name":"Tool Proficiency","description":"When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies.

Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.\n\nCreating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.\n\nWhen you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.\n\nYou can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table."},{"level":5,"name":"Alchemical Savant","description":"At 5th level, you develop masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell.

It also expands to cver your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips known column o f the Druid table.\n\n####Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell‚Äôs level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn‚Äôt remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n####Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells."},{"level":2,"name":"Wild Shape","description":"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature‚Äôs bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n* When you transform, you assume the beast‚Äôs hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn‚Äôt reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren‚Äôt knocked unconscious.\n* You can‚Äôt cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn‚Äôt break your concentration on a spell you‚Äôve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you‚Äôve already cast.\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can‚Äôt use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature‚Äôs shape and size.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\n#### Spellbook\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\n####Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell‚Äôs level or higher.

When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.\n\nWhen you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn."},{"level":2,"name":"Tactical Wit","description":"Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle.

The magic quill has the following properties:\n\n* The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.\n* The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.\n* You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.\n\nThis quill disappears if you create another one or if you die."},{"level":2,"name":"Awakened Spellbook","description":"Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.\n\nWhile you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:\n\n* You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n* When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.\n* When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nIf necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells.

As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).\n\nWhile manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).\n\nWhenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.\n\nThe spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts dispel magic on it, if the the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again."},{"level":10,"name":"Master Scrivener","description":"Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.\n\nThe chosen spell must be 1st or 2nd level and must have a casing time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.\n\nYou are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill."},{"level":14,"name":"One with the Word","description":"Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.\n\nMoreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.\n\nUntil you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook.\n\nOnce you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest."}]}]}]}
