{"model":"Rule","documents":[{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Ability Checks","description":"<p>\n  An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\n</p>\n<h5>Typical Difficulty Classes</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Very Hard</td><td>25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Nearly Impossible</td><td>30</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.\n</p>\n<h4>Group Checks</h4>\n<p>\n  Ability checks that require everyone to succeed to be a success (such as moving stealthily as a group) are made by averaging the result. So everyone in the party rolls their dice, adds their modifiers, and then the results are averaged to determine if the group succeeds or fails.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ability checks that require one person in the group to succeed for the whole group to succeed should be rolled by at most two characters, or one character assisted by another character (see the Help action).\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Scores","title":"Ability Scores","description":"<p>\n  Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The basic rule behind these rolls is to roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n<thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>1</td><td>-5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2-3</td><td>-4</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>4-5</td><td>-3</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>6-7</td><td>-2</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>8-9</td><td>-1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>10-11</td><td>+0</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>12-13</td><td>+1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>14-15</td><td>+2</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>16-17</td><td>+3</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>18-19</td><td>+4</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>20-21</td><td>+5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>22-23</td><td>+6</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>24-25</td><td>+7</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>26-27</td><td>+8</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>28-29</td><td>+9</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>30</td><td>+10</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Actions in Combat","description":"<p>\n  When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Activating an Item","description":"Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.\n\n#### Command Word\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\n#### Consumables\nSome items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.\n\n#### Spells\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.\n\n#### Charges\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained."},{"category":"Other Rules","subcategory":"Advantage and Disadvantage","title":"Advantage and Disadvantage","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\n</p>"},{"category":"Alignment","subcategory":"Alignment","title":"Alignment in the Multiverse","description":"<p>\n  For most thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments - they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.\n</p>"},{"category":"Alignment","subcategory":"Alignment","title":"Alignment","description":"<p>\n  A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Dexterity","title":"Armor Class","description":"<p>\n  Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Attack","description":"<p>\n  The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"Making an Attack\" section for the rules that govern attacks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Attack Rolls","description":"<p>\n  When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\n</p>\n<h5>Modifiers to the Roll</h5>\n<p>\n  When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Ability Modifier.</strong> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\n</p>\n<h5>Rolling 1 or 20</h5>\n<p>\n  Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Attunement","description":"Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class,\na creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.)\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its non magical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.\n\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.\n\nA creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily enda ttunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed."},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Movement and Positioning","title":"Being Prone","description":"<p>\n  Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed, rounded down. For example, if your speed is 9m, you must spend 4m of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every meter of movement while crawling costs 1 extra meter. Crawling 1 meter in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 meters of movement.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Blinded","description":"<p>\n  Certain effects cause a creature to be blinded or lose their sight in general. Other effects such as heavy obscurement might cause the effect of the blinded condition in regards to particular creatures or areas (such as heavy obscurement or the invisible condition).\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You can’t see and automatically fail any ability check requiring sight.</li>\n  <li>Attack rolls against you have advantage and your attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Movement and Positioning","title":"Breaking up Your Move","description":"<p>\n  You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 9m, you can move 3m, take your action, and then move 6m.\n</p>\n<h5>Moving Between Attacks</h5>\n<p>\n  If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 7m could move 3m, make an attack, move 4m, and then attack again.\n</p>\n<h5>Using Different Speeds</h5>\n<p>\n  If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if you have a speed of 9m and a flying speed of 18m because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 6m, then walk 3m, and then leap into the air to fly 9m more.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Cantrips","description":"<p>\n  A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Cast a Spell","description":"<p>\n  Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Casting a Spell","title":"Casting a Spell","description":"<p>\n  When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting in Armor</h5>\n<p>\n  Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h4>Casting Time</h4>\n<p>\n  Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n</p>\n<h5>Bonus Action</h5>\n<p>\n  A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n</p>\n<h5>Reactions</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n</p>\n<h5>Longer Casting Times</h5>\n<p>\n  Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>\n  The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. A few spells that rely on weapons or material components held in your hand may have a range equal to your reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spells range is equal to touch, you must be within your unarmed reach of the creature (typically 1m for a medium or smaller creature) and have a hand free to touch the target. If a spell has a range of reach the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding the material component required by the spell. For example, if the spell has a material component of a weapon (such as booming blade) the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding that weapon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\").\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h4>Components</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n</p>\n<h5>Verbal (V)</h5>\n<p>\n  Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n</p>\n<h5>Somatic (S)</h5>\n<p>\n  Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. This can be the same hand used to hold a material component or spellcasting focus.\n</p>\n<h5>Material (M)</h5>\n<p>\n  Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n</p>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n</p>\n<h5>Instantaneous</h5>\n<p>\n  Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n</p>\n<h5>Concentration</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n  <li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source o f damage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n</p>\n<h4>Targets</h4>\n<p>\n  A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it w as targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>A Clear Path to the Target</h5>\n<p>\n  To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n</p>\n<h5>Targeting Yourself</h5>\n<p>\n  If a spell targets a creature o f your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect o f a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\n</p>\n<h4>Areas of Effect</h4>\n<p>\n  Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes                              : cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n</p>\n<h5>Cone</h5>\n<p>\n  A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cube</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cylinder</h5>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Line</h5>\n<p>\n  A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Sphere</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in meters that extends from the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h4>Saving Throws</h4>\n<p>\n  Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\n</p>\n<h4>Attack Rolls</h4>\n<p>\n  Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within the reach of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.\n</p>\n<h4>Combining Magical Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Charisma","title":"Charisma Checks","description":"<p>\n  A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Deception.</strong> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Intimidation.</strong> When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out o f a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Performance.</strong> Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Persuasion.</strong> When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Other Charisma Checks.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>\n  <li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Charisma","title":"Spellcasting Ability","description":"<p>\n  Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs o f spells they cast.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Charmed","description":"<ul>\n  <li>You can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>\n  <li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to socially interact with you.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Movement","title":"Moving on a Grid","description":"Combat is typically managed using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, following these rules.\n\n**Spaces.** Each space on the grid represents 1 meter.\n\n**Speed.** Rather than moving meter by meter, move space by space on the grid. This means you use your speed in 1 meter segments.\n\n**Entering a space.** To enter a space, you must have at least 1 space of movement left. If you are moving diagonally, each space requires 1.5 spaces of movement (rounding down). So the first diagonal takes 1 meter of movement, but if you move diagonally twice as part of your move the second will cost 2 meters of movement. If a space costs extra movement, as a space of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 spaces of movement left to enter a space of difficult terrain.\n\n**Corners.** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\n\n**Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting spaces from a space adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.\n\n**Areas of Effect** When determining the center point for an area of effect that specifies a radius, measure from a corner rather than a center point to determine what squares are affected.\n\n##### Hex Grid\n\nIt is possible to use a hex grid instead of a square grid. When using a hex grid there are no diagonal moves, and all moves cost 1 space.\n\n##### 1 Meter Grid Size.\n\nWhen using a 1 meter grid size, make the following adjustments to the rules.\n\n**Weapon Reach** Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and the *light* property instead have a 1 meter reach. This also applies to unarmed strikes. Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and do not have the *light* property should have a 2 meter reach. Weapons that have a 10 ft reach should instead have a 3 meter reach. Weapons that have a 15 ft reach should instead have a 4 meter reach.\n\n**Weapon and Spell** Spells and weapons that have a range of touch should have a 1 meter range. Spells that have a range of 5 ft should have a 2 meter range. For all other spells, for every 10 ft give them a range of 3 meters, rounding down to the nearest meter (So 15 ft would be 4 meters).\n\n**Areas of Effect** Areas of effect should round down to the nearest meter, using the 10 ft = 3 meters translation. Some common areas translated:\n* 5 ft square - 1 m.\n* 10 ft square (Faerie Fire) - 3 x 3 m.\n* 15 ft cone (Burning Hands) - 4 meters across, by 4 meters long.\n* 60 ft line 5 ft wide (i.e. Lightning Bolt) - 18 x 1 m\n* 20 ft radius circle - 6 m radius.\n\n**Speed** Treat speeds similarly to weapon and spell range. So a speed of 25 ft becomes 7 meters, 30 ft becomes 9 meters, 35 ft becomes 10 meters, and 60 ft becomes 18 meters.\n\n**Space** When using a 1m space creature size becomes effectively smaller. This is to simplify space concerns and for increased compatibility with miniatures developed for the standard 5 ft space system.\n\n* **Tiny** - 2 tiny creatures fit in a single 1 x 1 x 1 m space.\n* **Small** - Small creatures fit 1 to a space.\n* **Medium** - Medium creatures take up 1 space.\n* **Large** - Large creatures would take up a 2 x 2 area.\n* **Huge** - Huge creatures would take up a 3 x 3 area.\n* **Gargantuan** - Gargantuan creatures would take up a 4 x 4.\n* **Colossal** - Colossal creatures would take up at least a 5 x 5 area or more.\n\n\n\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Constitution","title":"Constitution Checks","description":"<p>\n  Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Hold your breath</li>\n  <li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>\n  <li>Go without sleep</li>\n  <li>Survive without food or water</li>\n  <li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Constitution","title":"Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Contests","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Mounted Combat","title":"Controlling a Mount","description":"<p>\n  While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Cover","title":"Cover","description":"<p>\n  Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.

If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 1 meter-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 1 meter radius around another one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\n</p>\n<h5>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 1 meter wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra meter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Critical Hits","description":"<p>\n  When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target.

For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\n</p>\n<h4>Sample Diseases</h4>\n<p>\n  The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\n</p>\n<h5>Cackle Fever</h5>\n<p>\n  This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the shrieks.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any event that causes the infected creature great stress--including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 3m of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\n</p>\n<h5>Sewer Plague</h5>\n<p>\n  Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\n</p>\n<h5>Sight Rot</h5>\n<p>\n  This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight.

When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment.

After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Disengage","description":"<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Dodge","description":"<p>\n  When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks.

Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\n</p>\n<h5>Crafting</h5>\n<p>\n  You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 10 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 10 gp, you make progress every day in 10-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 150 days to craft by yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\n</p>\n<h5>Practicing a Profession</h5>\n<p>\n  You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\n</p>\n<h5>Recuperating</h5>\n<p>\n  You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n  <li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Researching</h5>\n<p>\n  The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\n</p>\n<h5>Training</h5>\n<p>\n  You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Dropping to 0 Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  When you drop to 0 hit points, you gain the Dying condition and then roll on the injury table (if applicable, see below).\n</p>\n<h5>Instant Death</h5>\n<p>\n  Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n</p>\n<h5>Death Saving Throws</h5>\n<p>\n  Whenever you have the dying condition, you may use your action make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Roll a d20. If the roll is 16 or higher, you succeed.

If they do, when you drop to 0 hit points due to damage, roll on the injury table for the damage type that dropped you to 0 hit points. To do so, you roll a d100 and add your constitution score. Compare the result to the table, and apply the listed effect to your character.\n</p>\n<h5>Monsters and Death</h5>\n<p>\n  Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it take the dying condition and make death saving throws.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Dying","description":"<p>\n  While you are dying the following effects apply to you:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You are prone and cannot stand up.</li>\n  <li>You have the slowed condition.</li>\n  <li>Every time you take damage while you have this condition you gain 2 levels of exhaustion.</li>\n  <li>You cannot concentrate on spells.</li>\n  <li>You cannot take reactions.</li>\n  <li>On your turn you can take an action or a bonus action, but not both.

The strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force.  These forces account for everything in our universe.  In the universe of Elthelas and D&amp;D there are additional forces that act on the universe, namely, the divine force, and the arcane force.\n</p>\n<h4>The Arcane Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The arcane force is emitted by arcanum, a rare material that is in fact a unique subatomic particle that is attracted to itself, and reacts to intentionality (a manifestation of the divine force) by emitting forces of its own on standard matter.  Most of the universes arcanum is noninteractive, and forms a barrier between the many \"planes\" of existence.  It is theorized that in ancient days the Gods built these walls of Arcanum to create greater order in the universe by separating arcanum from ordinary matter, allowing the divine force to act without causing unpredictable side effects.  However, philosophers have postulated that this theory may have a fundamental flaw, as the large collection of divine force necessary to form a God would have created massive chain reactions in a universe where Arcanum was more evenly distributed, likely dispersing the divine force in the process.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most accessible arcanum in the universe is found in crystal-like deposits.  Sometimes these deposits are buried in rock, sometimes they are free-floating, and on occasion they even fall from space.  Gravity appears to act on the deposits normally, but the other forces can have unpredictable results on a deposit of Arcanum.  Wizards have learned how to focus their divine soul to interact with arcanum deposits to produce predictable results, typically through a series of spoken chants and gestures, and sometimes by introducing other forms of matter that the arcane force can act on. The ability to produce increasingly powerful effects requires increasingly large deposits of arcanum (although it is not consumed in the process) however, repeated use of an arcanum crystal attracts free particles of arcanum, incrementally increasing the size of the crystal, and allowing more powerful magic to be cast with it (in game this is represented through a wizard or other arcane casters experience level).  Certain creatures and people have arcanum in their blood (such as dragons and sorcerers) this allows them to produce magical effects without an outside source of arcanum, but because they cannot inscribe on the arcanum, the number of effects they are able to produce is limited by the power of their divine spark. It is common practice among the bardic colleges to artificially infuse the blood with a small amount of arcanum so that the student can produce effects to dazzle and awe their audiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because Arcanum is self-attractive, events of massive magical significance can cause arcanum to congregate in a particular area. This leaves the area prone to strange occurrances. Occasionally some of the arcanum attracted leaks from the planar boundaries themselves, introducing new raw arcanum to the material plane, and a weak point into the boundary between worlds, often manifested as a portal or through the random passing back and forth of creatures between planes at that location.\n</p>\n<h4>The Divine Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The divine force is the manifestation of life itself, and can be generative or destructive, manifested in positive and negative energy.  The divine force has a unique ability to interact with organic compounds, causing them to react in a predictable (though complex) manner.  Every living thing is endowed with a certain amount of divine force.  The Gods are beings endowed with massive amounts of divine force.  The divine force is self-replenishing with time, such that creatures that use the divine force to produce some effect are drained for a time, but gain it back.  The divine force can also be granted to others (with training) although this weakens the one who grants it slightly.  Most mortals would die if they gave away their divine force, however, Gods give it to their chosen clerics and paladins regularly.  Druids and rangers draw divine force in small amounts from living things around them in the world, such as plants and animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both the negative and positive divine forces can be used to grant or destroy life, however they naturally repel one another. Further, it has been found that whether ones soul acts with the negative or positive force is determined by the sorts of things one does.  This has created the natural 'good', 'evil' dichotomy in the universe, as those who choose 'evil' acts emit a force that is naturally repulsive towards those who commit 'good' acts, however in most cases the force is too weak to act at any distance from the individual, and thus this repulsion is undetectable by normal means.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Frightened","description":"<ul>\n  <li>You have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of your fear is within line of sight.</li>\n  <li>You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Grappled","description":"<ul>\n  <li>Your speed becomes 0 and you cannot benefit from any bonus to your speed.</li>\n  <li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler.</li>\n  <li>The grappler can drag or carry you, but the grappler suffers the Slowed Condition while moving, unless you are at two or more sizes smaller than the grappler.</li>\n  <li>While grappled, you can make a dexterity (acrobatics) or strength (athletics) check against the grapples escape DC or opposed by the grappler's strength (athletics) at the end of each of your turns, ending the condition on a success.

Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physica l contact with the item.

(It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Invisible","description":"<ul>\n  <li>\n    You are impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.

Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Legendary Creatures","title":"Legendary Creatures","description":"<p>\n  A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn't gain that form's legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n</p>\n<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>\n<p>\n  A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions--called legendary actions--outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can't use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can't use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n</p>\n<h4>A Legendary Creature's Lair</h4>\n<p>\n  A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n</p>\n<h5>Lair Actions</h5>\n<p>\n  If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can't do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can't use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n</p>\n<h4>Regional Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\n</p>"},{"category":"Other Rules","subcategory":"Leveling Up","title":"Leveling Up","description":"<p>\n  As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).\n</p>\n<p>\n  When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level.

Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Your lifestyle choice can have consequences.

With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p>\n<p><strong>Squalid.</strong> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Modest.</strong> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\n</p>\n<h5>Self-Sufficiency</h5>\n<p>\n  The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford--paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle.

Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can a lso break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score , a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.\n</p>\n<h4>Madness Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in longterm or indefinite madness.\n</p>\n<h4>Curing Madness</h4>\n<p>\n  A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness.

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Potions\n\nDifferent kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid. Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion yourself requires a bonus action or action (your choice) while administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.\n\n#### Rings\n\nMagic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring's description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring's magic to function.\n\n#### Rods\n\nA scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. 60cm to 1m in length, 2-3 cm thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.\n\n#### Scrolls\n\nMost scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.\n\nA scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.\n\nAny creature that can understand a written language can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.\n\n#### Staffs\n\nA magic staff is about 2m long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.\n\n#### Wands\n\nA magic wand is about 40 cm long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nWhether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.\n\nSome magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Wondrous Items\n\nWondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets.

These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \"weapon\" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creature vs. Target</strong> The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \"target\" can be a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit.</strong> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \"Hit\" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Miss.</strong> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \"Miss:\" notation.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiattack</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Ammunition</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n</p>\n<h4>Reactions</h4>\n<p>\n  If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n</p>\n<h4>Limited Usage</h4>\n<p>\n  Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>X/day.</strong>  The notation \"X/Day\" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \"1/Day\" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Recharge X-Y.</strong> The notation \"Recharge X–Y\" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, \"Recharge 5–6\" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</strong> This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n</p>\n<h4>Grapple Rules for Monsters</h4>\n<p>\n  Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block.

Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Challenge","description":"<p>\n  A monster's challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Equipment","description":"<p>\n  A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster.

The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Tremorsense</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance.

Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.\n</p>\n<p>\n  An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate spell, but the spell has a \"self only\" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher.

The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list.

Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 9m, you must spend 4m of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 4m of movement left or if your speed is 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 1m of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.

Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\n</p>\n<h4>Prerequisites</h4>\n<p>\n  To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Ability Score Minimum</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Strength 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Dexterity 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Experience Points</h4>\n<p>\n  The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.\n</p>\n<h4>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h4>\n<p>\n  You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>\n<p>\n  Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclassing Proficiencies</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Proficiencies Gained</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Light armor, shields, one skill of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Light armor, simple weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>-</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Class Features</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h5>Channel Divinity</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\n</p>\n<h5>Extra Attack</h5>\n<p>\n  If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Unarmored Defense</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.\n</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting</h5>\n<p>\n  Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>3rd</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>4th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>5th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>7th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>8th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>9th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Non-Player Characters","title":"Non-Player Characters","description":"<p>\n  There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs for your home campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Racial Traits.</strong> You can add racial traits to an NPC.

Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\n</p>\n<h4>Statistics for Objects</h4>\n<p>\n  When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Armor Class</strong> An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Substance</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Cloth, Paper, Rope</td><td>11</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Crystal, glass, ice</td><td>13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>wood, bone</td><td>15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Stone</td><td>17</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Iron, steel</td><td>19</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Mithral</td><td>21</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Adamantine</td><td>23</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit Points.</strong> An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Fragile</th><th>Resilient</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td><td>2 (1d4)</td><td>5 (2d4)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Small (chest, lute)</td><td>3 (1d6)</td><td>10 (3d6)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td><td>4 (1d8)</td><td>18 (4d8)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Large (Cart)</td><td>5 (1d10)</td><td>27 (5d10)</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Huge and Gargantuan Objects.</strong> Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Objects and Damage Types.</strong> Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Damage Threshold.</strong> Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Obscured/Concealed","description":"<ul>\n  <li>Lightly obscured includes dim light, patchy fog, moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on wisdom(perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>\n  <li>Heavily obscured areas--such as darkness, opaque fog or dense foliage--blocks  vision entirely, a creature in the area effectively is blind.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Opportunity Attacks","description":"<p>\n  In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by.

You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 1 meter cube.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Injury.</strong> A creature that takes slashing or piercing damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated with injury poison is exposed to its effects.\n</p>\n<h4>Purchasing Poison</h4>\n<p>\n  In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they track down the poison they seek.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single doses of various poisons.\n</p>\n<h4>Crafting and Harvesting Poison</h4>\n<p>\n  During downtime between adventures, a character can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to create basic poison if the character has proficiency with a poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.\n</p>"},{"category":"Other Rules","subcategory":"Leveling Up","title":"Proficiency Bonus","description":"<p>\n  Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.

For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Slowed","description":"<ul>\n  <li>Limited Movement.

Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\n</p>\n<h4>Climbing, Swimming, or Crawling</h4>\n<p>\n  While climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs 1 extra meter (2 extra meters  in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\n</p>\n<h4>Jumping</h4>\n<p>\n  Your Strength determines how far you can jump.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Long Jump.</strong> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to 1/3 your Strength score if you move at least 3m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\n</p>\n<p>\n  High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of meters equal to 1 + 1/3 of your Strength modifier if you move at least 3m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Movement","title":"Speed","description":"<p>\n  Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in meters that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n</p>\n<h4>Travel Pace</h4>\n<p>\n  While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Forced March.</strong> The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th>Pace</th><th>Distance per Minute</th><th>Distance per Hour</th><th>Distance per Day</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Fast</td><td>120m</td><td>7km</td><td>56km</td><td>-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal</td><td>90m</td><td>5km</td><td>40km</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Slow</td><td>60m</td><td>3.5km</td><td>28km</td><td>Able to Use Stealth</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>\n<p>\n  The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors.

A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Spell Slots","description":"<p>\n  Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h5>\n<p>\n  When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Strength","title":"Strength Checks","description":"<p>\n  A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes.

Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Time","title":"Time","description":"<p>\n  In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires.

It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Two-Weapon Fighting","description":"<p>\n  When you take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can make one extra attack as part of the same Action.

Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, and slaadi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n</p>\n  <h5>Tags</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Unarmed Strike","description":"<p>\n  An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple,or shove a target within your reach (typically 1 meter for a medium or small creature).

Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A heavily obscured area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\n</p>\n  <h5>Blindsight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Darkvision</h5>\n<p>\n  Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n</p>\n<h5>Truesight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Wearing and Wielding Items","description":"Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.\n\nRare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.\n\n#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.\n\n#### Paired Items\n\nItems that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn.

The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as w hen searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to apply first aid to a wounded ally or diagnose an illness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orc s lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\n</p>\n<h5>Hearing at a Distance</h5>\n<p>\n  Your ability to hear something depends on how loud the thing is, the ambient noise where you are, the distance between you and the source of the sound, and the amount of detail you are trying to make out. Start with the below baseline table for distance and noise level to DC. A player should only need to roll a perception check if the required DC is higher than their passive perception.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n  <thead><tr><th></th><th>0 - 18m</th><th>18m - 36m</th><th>36m - 90m</th><th>90m - 300m</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Quiet (whisper)</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td><td>DC 30</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal (conversation, verbal spell components)</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Loud (shouting, combat)</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Very Loud (thunderwave, airplane noise)</td><td>DC -5</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 10</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nFrom there make additional modifications to the DC based on ambient noise and detail based on the guidance below:\n<ul>\n  <li>No or little ambient noise, for example outdoors with a little birdsong or perhaps in a quiet library - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Reasonable noise levels, for example background conversations in a shop or a musician playing in an otherwise empty bar - no modification</li>\n  <li>Loud background noises, such as a busy pub or the sounds of combat, increase the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Very loud background noise, such as explosions, increase the DC by 5</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Only need to perceive that a noise occurred - reduce the DC by 5</li>\n  <li>Low detail required, such as identifying someones voice (but not what they are saying) - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Moderate detail required, getting the gist of a conversation without making out every word - normal DC</li>\n  <li>High detail required, for example identifying a spell by its verbal component, getting a conversation correct word for word - increase the DC by 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  So, for example, a very common occurance may be that your wizard wants to identify a spell that is being cast before casting counterspell. He is within 18m (the range of counterspell) and the noise is of normal volume, so the base DC is 5. The background noise is loud (DC + 2) and the level of detail required is high (DC + 3). Making this a DC 10 check. Thankfully, our wizard has a passive perception of 10, and so he does not need to roll. However, if his passive perception were less than 10 (for example if he had a very low wisdom score) he may be required to roll in order to hear what the enemy caster is saying and thus know what spell is being cast.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Another common scenario maybe the case of the nighttime ambush. Most of the party is sleeping when the person on watch gets attacked. He shouts to try to wake up his compatriots. The sleeping wizard has a passive perception of 5, he took a -5 because he is sleeping and thus has disadvantage on perception checks. The ranger on watch is 20 meters away, making the base DC 10. There is little or no ambient noise (it is the quiet of night) and he only needs to perceive that the noise occured to be awakened, but probably needs moderate detail to understand why he was awakened. Therefore the DC to be awakened by the shout is 3 (so no check required) and the DC to understand that the ranger is warning them of danger is 8.\n</p>\n<h5>Finding a Hidden Object</h5>\n<p>\n  When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n  <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Wisdom","title":"Spellcasting Ability","description":"<p>\n  Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Working Together","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task.

In combat, this requires the Help action.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or m ore individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n</p>\n<h5>Group Checks</h5>\n<p>\n  When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment.

Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check.

The basic rule behind these rolls is to roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability.

The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as w hen searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to apply first aid to a wounded ally or diagnose an illness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orc s lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\n</p>\n<h5>Hearing at a Distance</h5>\n<p>\n  Your ability to hear something depends on how loud the thing is, the ambient noise where you are, the distance between you and the source of the sound, and the amount of detail you are trying to make out. Start with the below baseline table for distance and noise level to DC. A player should only need to roll a perception check if the required DC is higher than their passive perception.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n  <thead><tr><th></th><th>0 - 18m</th><th>18m - 36m</th><th>36m - 90m</th><th>90m - 300m</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Quiet (whisper)</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td><td>DC 30</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal (conversation, verbal spell components)</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Loud (shouting, combat)</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Very Loud (thunderwave, airplane noise)</td><td>DC -5</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 10</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nFrom there make additional modifications to the DC based on ambient noise and detail based on the guidance below:\n<ul>\n  <li>No or little ambient noise, for example outdoors with a little birdsong or perhaps in a quiet library - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Reasonable noise levels, for example background conversations in a shop or a musician playing in an otherwise empty bar - no modification</li>\n  <li>Loud background noises, such as a busy pub or the sounds of combat, increase the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Very loud background noise, such as explosions, increase the DC by 5</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Only need to perceive that a noise occurred - reduce the DC by 5</li>\n  <li>Low detail required, such as identifying someones voice (but not what they are saying) - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Moderate detail required, getting the gist of a conversation without making out every word - normal DC</li>\n  <li>High detail required, for example identifying a spell by its verbal component, getting a conversation correct word for word - increase the DC by 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  So, for example, a very common occurance may be that your wizard wants to identify a spell that is being cast before casting counterspell. He is within 18m (the range of counterspell) and the noise is of normal volume, so the base DC is 5. The background noise is loud (DC + 2) and the level of detail required is high (DC + 3). Making this a DC 10 check. Thankfully, our wizard has a passive perception of 10, and so he does not need to roll. However, if his passive perception were less than 10 (for example if he had a very low wisdom score) he may be required to roll in order to hear what the enemy caster is saying and thus know what spell is being cast.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Another common scenario maybe the case of the nighttime ambush. Most of the party is sleeping when the person on watch gets attacked. He shouts to try to wake up his compatriots. The sleeping wizard has a passive perception of 5, he took a -5 because he is sleeping and thus has disadvantage on perception checks. The ranger on watch is 20 meters away, making the base DC 10. There is little or no ambient noise (it is the quiet of night) and he only needs to perceive that the noise occured to be awakened, but probably needs moderate detail to understand why he was awakened. Therefore the DC to be awakened by the shout is 3 (so no check required) and the DC to understand that the ranger is warning them of danger is 8.\n</p>\n<h5>Finding a Hidden Object</h5>\n<p>\n  When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n  <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Wisdom","title":"Spellcasting Ability","description":"<p>\n  Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n</p>"}]}]},{"title":"Combat","subcategories":[{"title":"Actions in Combat","rules":[{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Actions in Combat","description":"<p>\n  When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.

The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\n</p>\n<h5>Modifiers to the Roll</h5>\n<p>\n  When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Ability Modifier.</strong> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity.

You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation.

For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 1 meter radius around another one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\n</p>\n<h5>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 1 meter wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra meter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.

This means you use your speed in 1 meter segments.\n\n**Entering a space.** To enter a space, you must have at least 1 space of movement left. If you are moving diagonally, each space requires 1.5 spaces of movement (rounding down). So the first diagonal takes 1 meter of movement, but if you move diagonally twice as part of your move the second will cost 2 meters of movement. If a space costs extra movement, as a space of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 spaces of movement left to enter a space of difficult terrain.\n\n**Corners.** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\n\n**Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting spaces from a space adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.\n\n**Areas of Effect** When determining the center point for an area of effect that specifies a radius, measure from a corner rather than a center point to determine what squares are affected.\n\n##### Hex Grid\n\nIt is possible to use a hex grid instead of a square grid. When using a hex grid there are no diagonal moves, and all moves cost 1 space.\n\n##### 1 Meter Grid Size.\n\nWhen using a 1 meter grid size, make the following adjustments to the rules.\n\n**Weapon Reach** Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and the *light* property instead have a 1 meter reach. This also applies to unarmed strikes. Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and do not have the *light* property should have a 2 meter reach. Weapons that have a 10 ft reach should instead have a 3 meter reach. Weapons that have a 15 ft reach should instead have a 4 meter reach.\n\n**Weapon and Spell** Spells and weapons that have a range of touch should have a 1 meter range. Spells that have a range of 5 ft should have a 2 meter range. For all other spells, for every 10 ft give them a range of 3 meters, rounding down to the nearest meter (So 15 ft would be 4 meters).\n\n**Areas of Effect** Areas of effect should round down to the nearest meter, using the 10 ft = 3 meters translation. Some common areas translated:\n* 5 ft square - 1 m.\n* 10 ft square (Faerie Fire) - 3 x 3 m.\n* 15 ft cone (Burning Hands) - 4 meters across, by 4 meters long.\n* 60 ft line 5 ft wide (i.e. Lightning Bolt) - 18 x 1 m\n* 20 ft radius circle - 6 m radius.\n\n**Speed** Treat speeds similarly to weapon and spell range. So a speed of 25 ft becomes 7 meters, 30 ft becomes 9 meters, 35 ft becomes 10 meters, and 60 ft becomes 18 meters.\n\n**Space** When using a 1m space creature size becomes effectively smaller. This is to simplify space concerns and for increased compatibility with miniatures developed for the standard 5 ft space system.\n\n* **Tiny** - 2 tiny creatures fit in a single 1 x 1 x 1 m space.\n* **Small** - Small creatures fit 1 to a space.\n* **Medium** - Medium creatures take up 1 space.\n* **Large** - Large creatures would take up a 2 x 2 area.\n* **Huge** - Huge creatures would take up a 3 x 3 area.\n* **Gargantuan** - Gargantuan creatures would take up a 4 x 4.\n* **Colossal** - Colossal creatures would take up at least a 5 x 5 area or more.\n\n\n\n"}]},{"title":"Damage and Healing","rules":[{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.

For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance.

For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.\n\n#### Command Word\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\n#### Consumables\nSome items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read.

The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.\n\n#### Charges\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Attunement","description":"Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class,\na creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.)\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its non magical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.\n\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.\n\nA creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item.

Discovering a magic item's properties isn't automatic, however.\n\nThe identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physica l contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.\n\nSometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling.\n\nWearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, \"Your steps feel strangely springy.\" Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high.\n\n#### Variant: More Difficult Identification\nIf you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the identify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Magic Item Categories","description":"\nEach magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.\n\n#### Armor\n\nunless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.

If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Potions\n\nDifferent kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid. Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion yourself requires a bonus action or action (your choice) while administering a potion to another character requires an action.

Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.\n\nAny creature that can understand a written language can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.\n\n#### Staffs\n\nA magic staff is about 2m long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.\n\n#### Wands\n\nA magic wand is about 40 cm long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nWhether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.\n\nSome magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Wondrous Items\n\nWondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all category.\n\n\n\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Rarity","description":"Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, such as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created.\n\nThus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities. Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items.\n\nIf your campaign allows for trade in magic items, rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, you determine the value of an individual magic item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Equipment section."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Wearing and Wielding Items","description":"Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.\n\nRare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.\n\n#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.\n\n#### Paired Items\n\nItems that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either item."}]},{"title":"What is a Spell","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Cantrips","description":"<p>\n  A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance.

A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Known and Prepared Spells","description":"<p>\n  Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Rituals","description":"<p>\n  Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Spell Level","description":"<p>\n  Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Spell Slots","description":"<p>\n  Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h5>\n<p>\n  When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"What is a Spell","description":"<p>\n  A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression.

The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting in Armor</h5>\n<p>\n  Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h4>Casting Time</h4>\n<p>\n  Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n</p>\n<h5>Bonus Action</h5>\n<p>\n  A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n</p>\n<h5>Reactions</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n</p>\n<h5>Longer Casting Times</h5>\n<p>\n  Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>\n  The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. A few spells that rely on weapons or material components held in your hand may have a range equal to your reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spells range is equal to touch, you must be within your unarmed reach of the creature (typically 1m for a medium or smaller creature) and have a hand free to touch the target. If a spell has a range of reach the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding the material component required by the spell. For example, if the spell has a material component of a weapon (such as booming blade) the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding that weapon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\").\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h4>Components</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n</p>\n<h5>Verbal (V)</h5>\n<p>\n  Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n</p>\n<h5>Somatic (S)</h5>\n<p>\n  Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. This can be the same hand used to hold a material component or spellcasting focus.\n</p>\n<h5>Material (M)</h5>\n<p>\n  Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n</p>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n</p>\n<h5>Instantaneous</h5>\n<p>\n  Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n</p>\n<h5>Concentration</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n  <li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source o f damage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n</p>\n<h4>Targets</h4>\n<p>\n  A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it w as targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>A Clear Path to the Target</h5>\n<p>\n  To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n</p>\n<h5>Targeting Yourself</h5>\n<p>\n  If a spell targets a creature o f your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect o f a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\n</p>\n<h4>Areas of Effect</h4>\n<p>\n  Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes                              : cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n</p>\n<h5>Cone</h5>\n<p>\n  A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cube</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cylinder</h5>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Line</h5>\n<p>\n  A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Sphere</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in meters that extends from the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h4>Saving Throws</h4>\n<p>\n  Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\n</p>\n<h4>Attack Rolls</h4>\n<p>\n  Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within the reach of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.\n</p>\n<h4>Combining Magical Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.\n</p>\n"}]},{"title":"Magic in Elthelas","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic in Elthelas","title":"Forces of Magic","description":"<p>\n  In our world we are familiar with the 4 fundamental forces.  The strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force.  These forces account for everything in our universe.  In the universe of Elthelas and D&amp;D there are additional forces that act on the universe, namely, the divine force, and the arcane force.\n</p>\n<h4>The Arcane Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The arcane force is emitted by arcanum, a rare material that is in fact a unique subatomic particle that is attracted to itself, and reacts to intentionality (a manifestation of the divine force) by emitting forces of its own on standard matter.  Most of the universes arcanum is noninteractive, and forms a barrier between the many \"planes\" of existence.  It is theorized that in ancient days the Gods built these walls of Arcanum to create greater order in the universe by separating arcanum from ordinary matter, allowing the divine force to act without causing unpredictable side effects.  However, philosophers have postulated that this theory may have a fundamental flaw, as the large collection of divine force necessary to form a God would have created massive chain reactions in a universe where Arcanum was more evenly distributed, likely dispersing the divine force in the process.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most accessible arcanum in the universe is found in crystal-like deposits.  Sometimes these deposits are buried in rock, sometimes they are free-floating, and on occasion they even fall from space.  Gravity appears to act on the deposits normally, but the other forces can have unpredictable results on a deposit of Arcanum.  Wizards have learned how to focus their divine soul to interact with arcanum deposits to produce predictable results, typically through a series of spoken chants and gestures, and sometimes by introducing other forms of matter that the arcane force can act on. The ability to produce increasingly powerful effects requires increasingly large deposits of arcanum (although it is not consumed in the process) however, repeated use of an arcanum crystal attracts free particles of arcanum, incrementally increasing the size of the crystal, and allowing more powerful magic to be cast with it (in game this is represented through a wizard or other arcane casters experience level).  Certain creatures and people have arcanum in their blood (such as dragons and sorcerers) this allows them to produce magical effects without an outside source of arcanum, but because they cannot inscribe on the arcanum, the number of effects they are able to produce is limited by the power of their divine spark. It is common practice among the bardic colleges to artificially infuse the blood with a small amount of arcanum so that the student can produce effects to dazzle and awe their audiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because Arcanum is self-attractive, events of massive magical significance can cause arcanum to congregate in a particular area. This leaves the area prone to strange occurrances. Occasionally some of the arcanum attracted leaks from the planar boundaries themselves, introducing new raw arcanum to the material plane, and a weak point into the boundary between worlds, often manifested as a portal or through the random passing back and forth of creatures between planes at that location.\n</p>\n<h4>The Divine Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The divine force is the manifestation of life itself, and can be generative or destructive, manifested in positive and negative energy.  The divine force has a unique ability to interact with organic compounds, causing them to react in a predictable (though complex) manner.  Every living thing is endowed with a certain amount of divine force.  The Gods are beings endowed with massive amounts of divine force.  The divine force is self-replenishing with time, such that creatures that use the divine force to produce some effect are drained for a time, but gain it back.  The divine force can also be granted to others (with training) although this weakens the one who grants it slightly.  Most mortals would die if they gave away their divine force, however, Gods give it to their chosen clerics and paladins regularly.  Druids and rangers draw divine force in small amounts from living things around them in the world, such as plants and animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both the negative and positive divine forces can be used to grant or destroy life, however they naturally repel one another. Further, it has been found that whether ones soul acts with the negative or positive force is determined by the sorts of things one does.  This has created the natural 'good', 'evil' dichotomy in the universe, as those who choose 'evil' acts emit a force that is naturally repulsive towards those who commit 'good' acts, however in most cases the force is too weak to act at any distance from the individual, and thus this repulsion is undetectable by normal means.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic in Elthelas","title":"Schools of Magic","description":"<h4>Abjuration</h4>\n<p>\n  Abjuration is the use of the arcane or divine force to create barriers. This includes creating and restoring the barriers between the planes, which includes banishment effects.  Dispelling effects and anti-magic fields are fields that remove or dampen the effects of arcanum or the divine spark, usually by creating a barrier that emits the dampening force that moves outward.\n</p>\n<h4>Conjuration</h4>\n<p>\n  Conjuration magic is the use of one of the forces to pierce the planar barriers and, usually, bring something across the gap. This can be anything from energy (such as in an orb of fire spell) to a living creature, to small amounts of divine force (such as in healing spells).\n</p>\n<h4>Divination</h4>\n<p>\n  Divination magic is the use of the forces to transmit energy over great distances, the energy transmitted can usually only be very small, and thus it is typically used for observational purposes.\n</p>\n<h4>Enchantment</h4>\n<p>\n  Enchantment is the use of the forces to manipulate the minds of others.  This is a delicate and difficult process, and often can only be done in broad strokes.  However, most good societies consider the use of enchantment magic on unwilling individuals to be a violation of personal freedom, and additionally it can leave lasting, and sometimes unpredictable, side effects.\n</p>\n<h4>Evocation</h4>\n<p>\n  Evocation is the direct application of arcane or divine force, sometimes to create other energy effects, and sometimes to simply apply force directly.\n</p>\n<h4>Illusion</h4>\n<p>\n  Illusion is the use of arcane or divine force to manipulate sound waves, light, and sometimes even smell.  It is a school that often requires a great deal of skill and finesse, but not necessarily a lot of power.\n</p>\n<h4>Necromancy</h4>\n<p>\n  Necromancy is an attempt to transfer the divine force from one creature to another, to animate non-living creatures, or tap directly into the positive and negative energy planes.\n</p>\n<h4>Transmutation</h4>\n<p>\n  Transmutation is the use of arcane or divine force to actively alter physical forms or infuse them with energy.  It is usually a temporary effect as it is very difficult to overcome a living objects morphic resonance (a manifestation of the divine force that remembers a natural form, this is why healing spells infuse a person with a small amount of additional divine force, it strengthens their morphic resonance allowing them to heal faster).\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Wild Magic","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Wild Magic","title":"Wild Magic Table","description":"Certain class features require you to roll a wild magic surge.

For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa.

A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20.

Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\n</p>\n<h4>Prerequisites</h4>\n<p>\n  To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Ability Score Minimum</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Strength 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Dexterity 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Experience Points</h4>\n<p>\n  The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.\n</p>\n<h4>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h4>\n<p>\n  You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>\n<p>\n  Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclassing Proficiencies</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Proficiencies Gained</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Light armor, shields, one skill of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Light armor, simple weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>-</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Class Features</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h5>Channel Divinity</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\n</p>\n<h5>Extra Attack</h5>\n<p>\n  If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Unarmored Defense</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.\n</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting</h5>\n<p>\n  Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>3rd</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>4th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>5th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>7th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>8th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>9th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"},{"category":"Other Rules","subcategory":"Leveling Up","title":"Proficiency Bonus","description":"<p>\n  Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks.

As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment--the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\n</p>"}]}]},{"title":"Alignment","subcategories":[{"title":"Alignment","rules":[{"category":"Alignment","subcategory":"Alignment","title":"Alignment in the Multiverse","description":"<p>\n  For most thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice.

Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\n</p>\n<h4>Sample Diseases</h4>\n<p>\n  The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\n</p>\n<h5>Cackle Fever</h5>\n<p>\n  This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the shrieks.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any event that causes the infected creature great stress--including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 3m of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\n</p>\n<h5>Sewer Plague</h5>\n<p>\n  Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\n</p>\n<h5>Sight Rot</h5>\n<p>\n  This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Legendary Creatures","rules":[{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Legendary Creatures","title":"Legendary Creatures","description":"<p>\n  A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can't use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can't use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n</p>\n<h4>A Legendary Creature's Lair</h4>\n<p>\n  A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n</p>\n<h5>Lair Actions</h5>\n<p>\n  If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can't do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can't use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n</p>\n<h4>Regional Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section.

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\n</p>\n<h4>Going Mad</h4>\n<p>\n  Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can a lso break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score , a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.\n</p>\n<h4>Madness Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in longterm or indefinite madness.\n</p>\n<h4>Curing Madness</h4>\n<p>\n  A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness.

This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.\n</p>\n<h5>Melee and Ranged Attacks</h5>\n<p>\n  The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \"weapon\" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creature vs. Target</strong> The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \"target\" can be a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit.</strong> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \"Hit\" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Miss.</strong> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \"Miss:\" notation.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiattack</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Ammunition</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n</p>\n<h4>Reactions</h4>\n<p>\n  If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n</p>\n<h4>Limited Usage</h4>\n<p>\n  Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>X/day.</strong>  The notation \"X/Day\" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \"1/Day\" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Recharge X-Y.</strong> The notation \"Recharge X–Y\" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, \"Recharge 5–6\" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</strong> This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n</p>\n<h4>Grapple Rules for Monsters</h4>\n<p>\n  Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Alignment","description":"<p>\n  A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation.

If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment.

The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range.

The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, and slaadi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n</p>\n  <h5>Tags</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Non-Player Characters","rules":[{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Non-Player Characters","title":"Non-Player Characters","description":"<p>\n  There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs for your home campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Racial Traits.</strong> You can add racial traits to an NPC.

Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\n</p>\n<h4>Statistics for Objects</h4>\n<p>\n  When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Armor Class</strong> An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Substance</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Cloth, Paper, Rope</td><td>11</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Crystal, glass, ice</td><td>13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>wood, bone</td><td>15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Stone</td><td>17</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Iron, steel</td><td>19</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Mithral</td><td>21</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Adamantine</td><td>23</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit Points.</strong> An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Fragile</th><th>Resilient</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td><td>2 (1d4)</td><td>5 (2d4)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Small (chest, lute)</td><td>3 (1d6)</td><td>10 (3d6)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td><td>4 (1d8)</td><td>18 (4d8)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Large (Cart)</td><td>5 (1d10)</td><td>27 (5d10)</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Huge and Gargantuan Objects.</strong> Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Objects and Damage Types.</strong> Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Damage Threshold.</strong> Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Poisons","rules":[{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Poisons","title":"Poisons","description":"<p>\n  Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, draw, and other evil creatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Poisons come in the following four types.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Contact.</strong> A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 1 meter cube.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Injury.</strong> A creature that takes slashing or piercing damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated with injury poison is exposed to its effects.\n</p>\n<h4>Purchasing Poison</h4>\n<p>\n  In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they track down the poison they seek.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single doses of various poisons.\n</p>\n<h4>Crafting and Harvesting Poison</h4>\n<p>\n  During downtime between adventures, a character can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to create basic poison if the character has proficiency with a poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison.

Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\n</p>\n<h5>Crafting</h5>\n<p>\n  You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 10 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 10 gp, you make progress every day in 10-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 150 days to craft by yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\n</p>\n<h5>Practicing a Profession</h5>\n<p>\n  You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\n</p>\n<h5>Recuperating</h5>\n<p>\n  You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n  <li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Researching</h5>\n<p>\n  The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.

With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p>\n<p><strong>Squalid.</strong> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Modest.</strong> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\n</p>\n<h5>Self-Sufficiency</h5>\n<p>\n  The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford--paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming.

A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\n</p>\n  <h5>Blindsight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Darkvision</h5>\n<p>\n  Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n</p>\n<h5>Truesight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Resting","rules":[{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Resting","title":"Long Rest","description":"<p>\n  A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours.

At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\n</p>\n<h4>Jumping</h4>\n<p>\n  Your Strength determines how far you can jump.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Long Jump.</strong> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to 1/3 your Strength score if you move at least 3m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm.

The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids.

The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\n</p>\n<h5>Typical Difficulty Classes</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Very Hard</td><td>25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Nearly Impossible</td><td>30</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.\n</p>\n<h4>Group Checks</h4>\n<p>\n  Ability checks that require everyone to succeed to be a success (such as moving stealthily as a group) are made by averaging the result. So everyone in the party rolls their dice, adds their modifiers, and then the results are averaged to determine if the group succeeds or fails.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ability checks that require one person in the group to succeed for the whole group to succeed should be rolled by at most two characters, or one character assisted by another character (see the Help action).\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Scores","title":"Ability Scores","description":"<p>\n  Is a character muscle-bound and insightful?

The basic rule behind these rolls is to roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.\n\n#### Command Word\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\n#### Consumables\nSome items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.\n\n#### Spells\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.\n\n#### Charges\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained."},{"category":"Other Rules","subcategory":"Advantage and Disadvantage","title":"Advantage and Disadvantage","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.

For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells.

(If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.)\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its non magical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.\n\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.\n\nA creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item.

Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Casting a Spell","title":"Casting a Spell","description":"<p>\n  When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting in Armor</h5>\n<p>\n  Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h4>Casting Time</h4>\n<p>\n  Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n</p>\n<h5>Bonus Action</h5>\n<p>\n  A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n</p>\n<h5>Reactions</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n</p>\n<h5>Longer Casting Times</h5>\n<p>\n  Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>\n  The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. A few spells that rely on weapons or material components held in your hand may have a range equal to your reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spells range is equal to touch, you must be within your unarmed reach of the creature (typically 1m for a medium or smaller creature) and have a hand free to touch the target. If a spell has a range of reach the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding the material component required by the spell. For example, if the spell has a material component of a weapon (such as booming blade) the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding that weapon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\").\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h4>Components</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n</p>\n<h5>Verbal (V)</h5>\n<p>\n  Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n</p>\n<h5>Somatic (S)</h5>\n<p>\n  Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. This can be the same hand used to hold a material component or spellcasting focus.\n</p>\n<h5>Material (M)</h5>\n<p>\n  Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n</p>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n</p>\n<h5>Instantaneous</h5>\n<p>\n  Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n</p>\n<h5>Concentration</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n  <li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source o f damage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n</p>\n<h4>Targets</h4>\n<p>\n  A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it w as targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>A Clear Path to the Target</h5>\n<p>\n  To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n</p>\n<h5>Targeting Yourself</h5>\n<p>\n  If a spell targets a creature o f your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect o f a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\n</p>\n<h4>Areas of Effect</h4>\n<p>\n  Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes                              : cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n</p>\n<h5>Cone</h5>\n<p>\n  A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cube</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cylinder</h5>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Line</h5>\n<p>\n  A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Sphere</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in meters that extends from the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h4>Saving Throws</h4>\n<p>\n  Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\n</p>\n<h4>Attack Rolls</h4>\n<p>\n  Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within the reach of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.\n</p>\n<h4>Combining Magical Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Charisma","title":"Charisma Checks","description":"<p>\n  A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Deception.</strong> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Intimidation.</strong> When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out o f a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Performance.</strong> Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Persuasion.</strong> When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Other Charisma Checks.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>\n  <li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Charisma","title":"Spellcasting Ability","description":"<p>\n  Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs o f spells they cast.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Charmed","description":"<ul>\n  <li>You can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>\n  <li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to socially interact with you.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Movement","title":"Moving on a Grid","description":"Combat is typically managed using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, following these rules.\n\n**Spaces.** Each space on the grid represents 1 meter.\n\n**Speed.** Rather than moving meter by meter, move space by space on the grid. This means you use your speed in 1 meter segments.\n\n**Entering a space.** To enter a space, you must have at least 1 space of movement left. If you are moving diagonally, each space requires 1.5 spaces of movement (rounding down). So the first diagonal takes 1 meter of movement, but if you move diagonally twice as part of your move the second will cost 2 meters of movement. If a space costs extra movement, as a space of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 spaces of movement left to enter a space of difficult terrain.\n\n**Corners.** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\n\n**Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting spaces from a space adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.\n\n**Areas of Effect** When determining the center point for an area of effect that specifies a radius, measure from a corner rather than a center point to determine what squares are affected.\n\n##### Hex Grid\n\nIt is possible to use a hex grid instead of a square grid. When using a hex grid there are no diagonal moves, and all moves cost 1 space.\n\n##### 1 Meter Grid Size.\n\nWhen using a 1 meter grid size, make the following adjustments to the rules.\n\n**Weapon Reach** Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and the *light* property instead have a 1 meter reach. This also applies to unarmed strikes. Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and do not have the *light* property should have a 2 meter reach. Weapons that have a 10 ft reach should instead have a 3 meter reach. Weapons that have a 15 ft reach should instead have a 4 meter reach.\n\n**Weapon and Spell** Spells and weapons that have a range of touch should have a 1 meter range. Spells that have a range of 5 ft should have a 2 meter range. For all other spells, for every 10 ft give them a range of 3 meters, rounding down to the nearest meter (So 15 ft would be 4 meters).\n\n**Areas of Effect** Areas of effect should round down to the nearest meter, using the 10 ft = 3 meters translation. Some common areas translated:\n* 5 ft square - 1 m.\n* 10 ft square (Faerie Fire) - 3 x 3 m.\n* 15 ft cone (Burning Hands) - 4 meters across, by 4 meters long.\n* 60 ft line 5 ft wide (i.e. Lightning Bolt) - 18 x 1 m\n* 20 ft radius circle - 6 m radius.\n\n**Speed** Treat speeds similarly to weapon and spell range. So a speed of 25 ft becomes 7 meters, 30 ft becomes 9 meters, 35 ft becomes 10 meters, and 60 ft becomes 18 meters.\n\n**Space** When using a 1m space creature size becomes effectively smaller. This is to simplify space concerns and for increased compatibility with miniatures developed for the standard 5 ft space system.\n\n* **Tiny** - 2 tiny creatures fit in a single 1 x 1 x 1 m space.\n* **Small** - Small creatures fit 1 to a space.\n* **Medium** - Medium creatures take up 1 space.\n* **Large** - Large creatures would take up a 2 x 2 area.\n* **Huge** - Huge creatures would take up a 3 x 3 area.\n* **Gargantuan** - Gargantuan creatures would take up a 4 x 4.\n* **Colossal** - Colossal creatures would take up at least a 5 x 5 area or more.\n\n\n\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Constitution","title":"Constitution Checks","description":"<p>\n  Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Hold your breath</li>\n  <li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>\n  <li>Go without sleep</li>\n  <li>Survive without food or water</li>\n  <li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Constitution","title":"Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Contests","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Mounted Combat","title":"Controlling a Mount","description":"<p>\n  While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Cover","title":"Cover","description":"<p>\n  Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.

If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 1 meter-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 1 meter radius around another one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\n</p>\n<h5>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 1 meter wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra meter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Critical Hits","description":"<p>\n  When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\n</p>\n<h4>Sample Diseases</h4>\n<p>\n  The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\n</p>\n<h5>Cackle Fever</h5>\n<p>\n  This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the shrieks.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any event that causes the infected creature great stress--including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 3m of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\n</p>\n<h5>Sewer Plague</h5>\n<p>\n  Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\n</p>\n<h5>Sight Rot</h5>\n<p>\n  This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Disengage","description":"<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Dodge","description":"<p>\n  When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Between Adventures","title":"Downtime Activities","description":"<p>\n  Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\n</p>\n<h5>Crafting</h5>\n<p>\n  You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 10 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 10 gp, you make progress every day in 10-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 150 days to craft by yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\n</p>\n<h5>Practicing a Profession</h5>\n<p>\n  You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\n</p>\n<h5>Recuperating</h5>\n<p>\n  You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>\n  <li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Researching</h5>\n<p>\n  The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\n</p>\n<h5>Training</h5>\n<p>\n  You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Dropping to 0 Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  When you drop to 0 hit points, you gain the Dying condition and then roll on the injury table (if applicable, see below).\n</p>\n<h5>Instant Death</h5>\n<p>\n  Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n</p>\n<h5>Death Saving Throws</h5>\n<p>\n  Whenever you have the dying condition, you may use your action make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Roll a d20. If the roll is 16 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success ends the dying condition and you gain 1 hit point. A failure has no effect on its own, but as the dying condition applies increasing levels of exhaustion you will creep closer and closer to death.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you immediately roll on the injury table for the damage type and adjudicate the effects. You cannot have fewer than 0 hit points.\n</p>\n<h5>Optional Rule: Injury</h5>\n<p>\n  Your DM may opt to use the injury table. If they do, when you drop to 0 hit points due to damage, roll on the injury table for the damage type that dropped you to 0 hit points. To do so, you roll a d100 and add your constitution score. Compare the result to the table, and apply the listed effect to your character.\n</p>\n<h5>Monsters and Death</h5>\n<p>\n  Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it take the dying condition and make death saving throws.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Dying","description":"<p>\n  While you are dying the following effects apply to you:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You are prone and cannot stand up.</li>\n  <li>You have the slowed condition.</li>\n  <li>Every time you take damage while you have this condition you gain 2 levels of exhaustion.</li>\n  <li>You cannot concentrate on spells.</li>\n  <li>You cannot take reactions.</li>\n  <li>On your turn you can take an action or a bonus action, but not both.

The strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force.  These forces account for everything in our universe.  In the universe of Elthelas and D&amp;D there are additional forces that act on the universe, namely, the divine force, and the arcane force.\n</p>\n<h4>The Arcane Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The arcane force is emitted by arcanum, a rare material that is in fact a unique subatomic particle that is attracted to itself, and reacts to intentionality (a manifestation of the divine force) by emitting forces of its own on standard matter.  Most of the universes arcanum is noninteractive, and forms a barrier between the many \"planes\" of existence.  It is theorized that in ancient days the Gods built these walls of Arcanum to create greater order in the universe by separating arcanum from ordinary matter, allowing the divine force to act without causing unpredictable side effects.  However, philosophers have postulated that this theory may have a fundamental flaw, as the large collection of divine force necessary to form a God would have created massive chain reactions in a universe where Arcanum was more evenly distributed, likely dispersing the divine force in the process.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most accessible arcanum in the universe is found in crystal-like deposits.  Sometimes these deposits are buried in rock, sometimes they are free-floating, and on occasion they even fall from space.  Gravity appears to act on the deposits normally, but the other forces can have unpredictable results on a deposit of Arcanum.  Wizards have learned how to focus their divine soul to interact with arcanum deposits to produce predictable results, typically through a series of spoken chants and gestures, and sometimes by introducing other forms of matter that the arcane force can act on. The ability to produce increasingly powerful effects requires increasingly large deposits of arcanum (although it is not consumed in the process) however, repeated use of an arcanum crystal attracts free particles of arcanum, incrementally increasing the size of the crystal, and allowing more powerful magic to be cast with it (in game this is represented through a wizard or other arcane casters experience level).  Certain creatures and people have arcanum in their blood (such as dragons and sorcerers) this allows them to produce magical effects without an outside source of arcanum, but because they cannot inscribe on the arcanum, the number of effects they are able to produce is limited by the power of their divine spark. It is common practice among the bardic colleges to artificially infuse the blood with a small amount of arcanum so that the student can produce effects to dazzle and awe their audiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because Arcanum is self-attractive, events of massive magical significance can cause arcanum to congregate in a particular area. This leaves the area prone to strange occurrances. Occasionally some of the arcanum attracted leaks from the planar boundaries themselves, introducing new raw arcanum to the material plane, and a weak point into the boundary between worlds, often manifested as a portal or through the random passing back and forth of creatures between planes at that location.\n</p>\n<h4>The Divine Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The divine force is the manifestation of life itself, and can be generative or destructive, manifested in positive and negative energy.  The divine force has a unique ability to interact with organic compounds, causing them to react in a predictable (though complex) manner.  Every living thing is endowed with a certain amount of divine force.  The Gods are beings endowed with massive amounts of divine force.  The divine force is self-replenishing with time, such that creatures that use the divine force to produce some effect are drained for a time, but gain it back.  The divine force can also be granted to others (with training) although this weakens the one who grants it slightly.  Most mortals would die if they gave away their divine force, however, Gods give it to their chosen clerics and paladins regularly.  Druids and rangers draw divine force in small amounts from living things around them in the world, such as plants and animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both the negative and positive divine forces can be used to grant or destroy life, however they naturally repel one another. Further, it has been found that whether ones soul acts with the negative or positive force is determined by the sorts of things one does.

The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling.\n\nWearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties.

Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment.

You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility.

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\n</p>\n<h4>Going Mad</h4>\n<p>\n  Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can a lso break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score , a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.\n</p>\n<h4>Madness Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in longterm or indefinite madness.\n</p>\n<h4>Curing Madness</h4>\n<p>\n  A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Magic Item Categories","description":"\nEach magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.\n\n#### Armor\n\nunless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function. Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Potions\n\nDifferent kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid. Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion yourself requires a bonus action or action (your choice) while administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.\n\n#### Rings\n\nMagic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring's description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring's magic to function.\n\n#### Rods\n\nA scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. 60cm to 1m in length, 2-3 cm thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.\n\n#### Scrolls\n\nMost scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.\n\nA scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.\n\nAny creature that can understand a written language can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.\n\n#### Staffs\n\nA magic staff is about 2m long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.\n\n#### Wands\n\nA magic wand is about 40 cm long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nWhether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.\n\nSome magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Wondrous Items\n\nWondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all category.\n\n\n\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Making an Attack","description":"<p>\n  Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose a target.</strong> Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>\n  <li><strong>Determine modifiers.</strong> The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target.

This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.\n</p>\n<h5>Melee and Ranged Attacks</h5>\n<p>\n  The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \"weapon\" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creature vs. Target</strong> The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \"target\" can be a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit.</strong> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \"Hit\" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Miss.</strong> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \"Miss:\" notation.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiattack</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Ammunition</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n</p>\n<h4>Reactions</h4>\n<p>\n  If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n</p>\n<h4>Limited Usage</h4>\n<p>\n  Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>X/day.</strong>  The notation \"X/Day\" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \"1/Day\" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Recharge X-Y.</strong> The notation \"Recharge X–Y\" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, \"Recharge 5–6\" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</strong> This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n</p>\n<h4>Grapple Rules for Monsters</h4>\n<p>\n  Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Alignment","description":"<p>\n  A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation.

Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Challenge","description":"<p>\n  A monster's challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle.

Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Ability Score Minimum</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Strength 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Dexterity 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Charisma 13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Intelligence 13</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Experience Points</h4>\n<p>\n  The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.\n</p>\n<h4>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h4>\n<p>\n  You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>\n<p>\n  Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclassing Proficiencies</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Proficiencies Gained</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Light armor, shields, one skill of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Light armor, simple weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>-</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Class Features</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h5>Channel Divinity</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\n</p>\n<h5>Extra Attack</h5>\n<p>\n  If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Unarmored Defense</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.\n</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting</h5>\n<p>\n  Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>3rd</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>4th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>5th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>7th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>8th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>9th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Non-Player Characters","title":"Non-Player Characters","description":"<p>\n  There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs for your home campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Racial Traits.</strong> You can add racial traits to an NPC.

For more on racial traits, see the Player's Handbook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spell Swaps.</strong> One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Armor and Weapon Swaps.</strong> You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC's challenge rating.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Magic Items.</strong> The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession.

Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Objects","title":"Objects","description":"<p>\n  When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\n</p>\n<h4>Statistics for Objects</h4>\n<p>\n  When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Armor Class</strong> An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Substance</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Cloth, Paper, Rope</td><td>11</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Crystal, glass, ice</td><td>13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>wood, bone</td><td>15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Stone</td><td>17</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Iron, steel</td><td>19</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Mithral</td><td>21</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Adamantine</td><td>23</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit Points.</strong> An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Fragile</th><th>Resilient</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td><td>2 (1d4)</td><td>5 (2d4)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Small (chest, lute)</td><td>3 (1d6)</td><td>10 (3d6)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td><td>4 (1d8)</td><td>18 (4d8)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Large (Cart)</td><td>5 (1d10)</td><td>27 (5d10)</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Huge and Gargantuan Objects.</strong> Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Objects and Damage Types.</strong> Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Damage Threshold.</strong> Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Obscured/Concealed","description":"<ul>\n  <li>Lightly obscured includes dim light, patchy fog, moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on wisdom(perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>\n  <li>Heavily obscured areas--such as darkness, opaque fog or dense foliage--blocks  vision entirely, a creature in the area effectively is blind.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Opportunity Attacks","description":"<p>\n  In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by.

The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison.

This includes creating and restoring the barriers between the planes, which includes banishment effects.  Dispelling effects and anti-magic fields are fields that remove or dampen the effects of arcanum or the divine spark, usually by creating a barrier that emits the dampening force that moves outward.\n</p>\n<h4>Conjuration</h4>\n<p>\n  Conjuration magic is the use of one of the forces to pierce the planar barriers and, usually, bring something across the gap. This can be anything from energy (such as in an orb of fire spell) to a living creature, to small amounts of divine force (such as in healing spells).\n</p>\n<h4>Divination</h4>\n<p>\n  Divination magic is the use of the forces to transmit energy over great distances, the energy transmitted can usually only be very small, and thus it is typically used for observational purposes.\n</p>\n<h4>Enchantment</h4>\n<p>\n  Enchantment is the use of the forces to manipulate the minds of others.  This is a delicate and difficult process, and often can only be done in broad strokes.  However, most good societies consider the use of enchantment magic on unwilling individuals to be a violation of personal freedom, and additionally it can leave lasting, and sometimes unpredictable, side effects.\n</p>\n<h4>Evocation</h4>\n<p>\n  Evocation is the direct application of arcane or divine force, sometimes to create other energy effects, and sometimes to simply apply force directly.\n</p>\n<h4>Illusion</h4>\n<p>\n  Illusion is the use of arcane or divine force to manipulate sound waves, light, and sometimes even smell.  It is a school that often requires a great deal of skill and finesse, but not necessarily a lot of power.\n</p>\n<h4>Necromancy</h4>\n<p>\n  Necromancy is an attempt to transfer the divine force from one creature to another, to animate non-living creatures, or tap directly into the positive and negative energy planes.\n</p>\n<h4>Transmutation</h4>\n<p>\n  Transmutation is the use of arcane or divine force to actively alter physical forms or infuse them with energy.  It is usually a temporary effect as it is very difficult to overcome a living objects morphic resonance (a manifestation of the divine force that remembers a natural form, this is why healing spells infuse a person with a small amount of additional divine force, it strengthens their morphic resonance allowing them to heal faster).\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Search","description":"<p>\n  When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Pay</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Coach Cab (between towns)</td><td>3 cp per mile</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Coach cab (within a city)</td><td>1 cp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Hireling (Skilled)</td><td>2 gp per day</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Hireling (Untrained)</td><td>2 sp per day</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Messenger</td><td>2 cp per mile</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Road or gate toll</td><td>1 cp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ship's passage</td><td>1 sp per mile</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\n</p>\n<h4>Spellcasting Services</h4>\n<p>\n  People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment--the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Resting","title":"Short Rest","description":"<p>\n  A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level.

A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Skills with Different Abilities","description":"<p>\n  Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Conditions","title":"Slowed","description":"<ul>\n  <li>Limited Movement.

At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\n</p>\n<h4>Jumping</h4>\n<p>\n  Your Strength determines how far you can jump.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Long Jump.</strong> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to 1/3 your Strength score if you move at least 3m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\n</p>\n<p>\n  High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of meters equal to 1 + 1/3 of your Strength modifier if you move at least 3m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump.

The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Forced March.</strong> The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th>Pace</th><th>Distance per Minute</th><th>Distance per Hour</th><th>Distance per Day</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Fast</td><td>120m</td><td>7km</td><td>56km</td><td>-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal</td><td>90m</td><td>5km</td><td>40km</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Slow</td><td>60m</td><td>3.5km</td><td>28km</td><td>Able to Use Stealth</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>\n<p>\n  The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors.

The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly.

Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h5>\n<p>\n  When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Strength","title":"Strength Checks","description":"<p>\n  A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.

Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n</p>\n  <h5>Tags</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n</p>"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Making an Attack","title":"Unarmed Strike","description":"<p>\n  An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple,or shove a target within your reach (typically 1 meter for a medium or small creature).

Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A heavily obscured area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\n</p>\n  <h5>Blindsight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Darkvision</h5>\n<p>\n  Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n</p>\n<h5>Truesight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Wearing and Wielding Items","description":"Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.\n\nRare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.\n\n#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.\n\n#### Paired Items\n\nItems that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either item."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"What is a Spell","description":"<p>\n  A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten.

The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as w hen searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to apply first aid to a wounded ally or diagnose an illness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orc s lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\n</p>\n<h5>Hearing at a Distance</h5>\n<p>\n  Your ability to hear something depends on how loud the thing is, the ambient noise where you are, the distance between you and the source of the sound, and the amount of detail you are trying to make out. Start with the below baseline table for distance and noise level to DC. A player should only need to roll a perception check if the required DC is higher than their passive perception.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n  <thead><tr><th></th><th>0 - 18m</th><th>18m - 36m</th><th>36m - 90m</th><th>90m - 300m</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Quiet (whisper)</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td><td>DC 30</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal (conversation, verbal spell components)</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Loud (shouting, combat)</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Very Loud (thunderwave, airplane noise)</td><td>DC -5</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 10</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nFrom there make additional modifications to the DC based on ambient noise and detail based on the guidance below:\n<ul>\n  <li>No or little ambient noise, for example outdoors with a little birdsong or perhaps in a quiet library - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Reasonable noise levels, for example background conversations in a shop or a musician playing in an otherwise empty bar - no modification</li>\n  <li>Loud background noises, such as a busy pub or the sounds of combat, increase the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Very loud background noise, such as explosions, increase the DC by 5</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Only need to perceive that a noise occurred - reduce the DC by 5</li>\n  <li>Low detail required, such as identifying someones voice (but not what they are saying) - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Moderate detail required, getting the gist of a conversation without making out every word - normal DC</li>\n  <li>High detail required, for example identifying a spell by its verbal component, getting a conversation correct word for word - increase the DC by 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  So, for example, a very common occurance may be that your wizard wants to identify a spell that is being cast before casting counterspell. He is within 18m (the range of counterspell) and the noise is of normal volume, so the base DC is 5. The background noise is loud (DC + 2) and the level of detail required is high (DC + 3). Making this a DC 10 check. Thankfully, our wizard has a passive perception of 10, and so he does not need to roll. However, if his passive perception were less than 10 (for example if he had a very low wisdom score) he may be required to roll in order to hear what the enemy caster is saying and thus know what spell is being cast.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Another common scenario maybe the case of the nighttime ambush. Most of the party is sleeping when the person on watch gets attacked. He shouts to try to wake up his compatriots. The sleeping wizard has a passive perception of 5, he took a -5 because he is sleeping and thus has disadvantage on perception checks. The ranger on watch is 20 meters away, making the base DC 10. There is little or no ambient noise (it is the quiet of night) and he only needs to perceive that the noise occured to be awakened, but probably needs moderate detail to understand why he was awakened. Therefore the DC to be awakened by the shout is 3 (so no check required) and the DC to understand that the ranger is warning them of danger is 8.\n</p>\n<h5>Finding a Hidden Object</h5>\n<p>\n  When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n  <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Wisdom","title":"Spellcasting Ability","description":"<p>\n  Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Working Together","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or m ore individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n</p>\n<h5>Group Checks</h5>\n<p>\n  When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group.

When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC.

As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.\n</p>\n<h4>Group Checks</h4>\n<p>\n  Ability checks that require everyone to succeed to be a success (such as moving stealthily as a group) are made by averaging the result. So everyone in the party rolls their dice, adds their modifiers, and then the results are averaged to determine if the group succeeds or fails.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ability checks that require one person in the group to succeed for the whole group to succeed should be rolled by at most two characters, or one character assisted by another character (see the Help action).\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Contests","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s.

This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks.

That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it.

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Skills","description":"<p>\n  Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Skills with Different Abilities","description":"<p>\n  Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\n</p>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Ability Checks","title":"Working Together","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or m ore individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n</p>\n<h5>Group Checks</h5>\n<p>\n  When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.

Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to apply first aid to a wounded ally or diagnose an illness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orc s lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\n</p>\n<h5>Hearing at a Distance</h5>\n<p>\n  Your ability to hear something depends on how loud the thing is, the ambient noise where you are, the distance between you and the source of the sound, and the amount of detail you are trying to make out. Start with the below baseline table for distance and noise level to DC. A player should only need to roll a perception check if the required DC is higher than their passive perception.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n  <thead><tr><th></th><th>0 - 18m</th><th>18m - 36m</th><th>36m - 90m</th><th>90m - 300m</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Quiet (whisper)</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td><td>DC 30</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal (conversation, verbal spell components)</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td><td>DC 25</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Loud (shouting, combat)</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 10</td><td>DC 15</td><td>DC 20</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Very Loud (thunderwave, airplane noise)</td><td>DC -5</td><td>DC 0</td><td>DC 5</td><td>DC 10</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nFrom there make additional modifications to the DC based on ambient noise and detail based on the guidance below:\n<ul>\n  <li>No or little ambient noise, for example outdoors with a little birdsong or perhaps in a quiet library - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Reasonable noise levels, for example background conversations in a shop or a musician playing in an otherwise empty bar - no modification</li>\n  <li>Loud background noises, such as a busy pub or the sounds of combat, increase the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Very loud background noise, such as explosions, increase the DC by 5</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Only need to perceive that a noise occurred - reduce the DC by 5</li>\n  <li>Low detail required, such as identifying someones voice (but not what they are saying) - reduce the DC by 2</li>\n  <li>Moderate detail required, getting the gist of a conversation without making out every word - normal DC</li>\n  <li>High detail required, for example identifying a spell by its verbal component, getting a conversation correct word for word - increase the DC by 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  So, for example, a very common occurance may be that your wizard wants to identify a spell that is being cast before casting counterspell. He is within 18m (the range of counterspell) and the noise is of normal volume, so the base DC is 5. The background noise is loud (DC + 2) and the level of detail required is high (DC + 3). Making this a DC 10 check. Thankfully, our wizard has a passive perception of 10, and so he does not need to roll. However, if his passive perception were less than 10 (for example if he had a very low wisdom score) he may be required to roll in order to hear what the enemy caster is saying and thus know what spell is being cast.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Another common scenario maybe the case of the nighttime ambush. Most of the party is sleeping when the person on watch gets attacked. He shouts to try to wake up his compatriots. The sleeping wizard has a passive perception of 5, he took a -5 because he is sleeping and thus has disadvantage on perception checks. The ranger on watch is 20 meters away, making the base DC 10. There is little or no ambient noise (it is the quiet of night) and he only needs to perceive that the noise occured to be awakened, but probably needs moderate detail to understand why he was awakened. Therefore the DC to be awakened by the shout is 3 (so no check required) and the DC to understand that the ranger is warning them of danger is 8.\n</p>\n<h5>Finding a Hidden Object</h5>\n<p>\n  When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n  <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul>"},{"category":"Abilities","subcategory":"Wisdom","title":"Spellcasting Ability","description":"<p>\n  Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n</p>"}]}]},{"title":"Combat","subcategories":[{"title":"Actions in Combat","rules":[{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Actions in Combat","title":"Actions in Combat","description":"<p>\n  When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.

This means you use your speed in 1 meter segments.\n\n**Entering a space.** To enter a space, you must have at least 1 space of movement left. If you are moving diagonally, each space requires 1.5 spaces of movement (rounding down). So the first diagonal takes 1 meter of movement, but if you move diagonally twice as part of your move the second will cost 2 meters of movement. If a space costs extra movement, as a space of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 spaces of movement left to enter a space of difficult terrain.\n\n**Corners.** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\n\n**Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting spaces from a space adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.\n\n**Areas of Effect** When determining the center point for an area of effect that specifies a radius, measure from a corner rather than a center point to determine what squares are affected.\n\n##### Hex Grid\n\nIt is possible to use a hex grid instead of a square grid. When using a hex grid there are no diagonal moves, and all moves cost 1 space.\n\n##### 1 Meter Grid Size.\n\nWhen using a 1 meter grid size, make the following adjustments to the rules.\n\n**Weapon Reach** Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and the *light* property instead have a 1 meter reach. This also applies to unarmed strikes. Weapons that have a 5 ft reach and do not have the *light* property should have a 2 meter reach. Weapons that have a 10 ft reach should instead have a 3 meter reach. Weapons that have a 15 ft reach should instead have a 4 meter reach.\n\n**Weapon and Spell** Spells and weapons that have a range of touch should have a 1 meter range. Spells that have a range of 5 ft should have a 2 meter range. For all other spells, for every 10 ft give them a range of 3 meters, rounding down to the nearest meter (So 15 ft would be 4 meters).\n\n**Areas of Effect** Areas of effect should round down to the nearest meter, using the 10 ft = 3 meters translation. Some common areas translated:\n* 5 ft square - 1 m.\n* 10 ft square (Faerie Fire) - 3 x 3 m.\n* 15 ft cone (Burning Hands) - 4 meters across, by 4 meters long.\n* 60 ft line 5 ft wide (i.e. Lightning Bolt) - 18 x 1 m\n* 20 ft radius circle - 6 m radius.\n\n**Speed** Treat speeds similarly to weapon and spell range. So a speed of 25 ft becomes 7 meters, 30 ft becomes 9 meters, 35 ft becomes 10 meters, and 60 ft becomes 18 meters.\n\n**Space** When using a 1m space creature size becomes effectively smaller. This is to simplify space concerns and for increased compatibility with miniatures developed for the standard 5 ft space system.\n\n* **Tiny** - 2 tiny creatures fit in a single 1 x 1 x 1 m space.\n* **Small** - Small creatures fit 1 to a space.\n* **Medium** - Medium creatures take up 1 space.\n* **Large** - Large creatures would take up a 2 x 2 area.\n* **Huge** - Huge creatures would take up a 3 x 3 area.\n* **Gargantuan** - Gargantuan creatures would take up a 4 x 4.\n* **Colossal** - Colossal creatures would take up at least a 5 x 5 area or more.\n\n\n\n"}]},{"title":"Damage and Healing","rules":[{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Hit Points","description":"<p>\n  Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.

This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points.

To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier.

If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Damage Rolls","description":"<p>\n  Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals.

When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n</p>\n<h5>Death Saving Throws</h5>\n<p>\n  Whenever you have the dying condition, you may use your action make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Roll a d20. If the roll is 16 or higher, you succeed.

If they do, when you drop to 0 hit points due to damage, roll on the injury table for the damage type that dropped you to 0 hit points. To do so, you roll a d100 and add your constitution score. Compare the result to the table, and apply the listed effect to your character.\n</p>\n<h5>Monsters and Death</h5>\n<p>\n  Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it take the dying condition and make death saving throws.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Healing","description":"<p>\n  Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent.

A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Damage and Healing","title":"Knocking a Creature Out","description":"<p>\n  Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow.

Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.\n</p>\n"}]},{"title":"Mounted Combat","rules":[{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Mounted Combat","title":"Controlling a Mount","description":"<p>\n  While you're mounted, you have two options.

Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\n</p>\n<h5>Combat Step by Step</h5>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>\n  <li><strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located.

A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Order of Combat","title":"Surprise","description":"<p>\n  A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat starts combat with the surprised condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\n</p>\n"},{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Order of Combat","title":"Your Turn","description":"<p>\n  On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed--sometimes called your walking speed--is noted on your character sheet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The \"Movement and Position\" section gives the rules for your move.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \"Actions in Combat.\"\n</p>\n  <h5>Bonus Actions</h5>\n<p>\n  Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n</p>\n<h5>Other Activity on Your Turn</h5>\n<p>\n  Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n</p>\n"}]},{"title":"Underwater Combat","rules":[{"category":"Combat","subcategory":"Underwater Combat","title":"Underwater Combat","description":"<p>\n  When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.\n\n#### Command Word\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\n#### Consumables\nSome items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.\n\n#### Spells\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.\n\n#### Charges\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Attunement","description":"Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class,\na creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.)\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its non magical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.\n\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.\n\nA creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily enda ttunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Cursed Items","description":"Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their user, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. A magic item's description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including the identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although one might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's user when the curse's effects are revealed.\n\nAttunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the remove curse spell."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Identifying a Magic Item","description":"Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item's properties isn't automatic, however.\n\nThe identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physica l contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.\n\nSometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling.\n\nWearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, \"Your steps feel strangely springy.\" Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high.\n\n#### Variant: More Difficult Identification\nIf you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the identify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Magic Item Categories","description":"\nEach magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.\n\n#### Armor\n\nunless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function. Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Potions\n\nDifferent kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid. Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion yourself requires a bonus action or action (your choice) while administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.\n\n#### Rings\n\nMagic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring's description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring's magic to function.\n\n#### Rods\n\nA scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. 60cm to 1m in length, 2-3 cm thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.\n\n#### Scrolls\n\nMost scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.\n\nA scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.\n\nAny creature that can understand a written language can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to activate it.\n\n#### Staffs\n\nA magic staff is about 2m long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.\n\n#### Wands\n\nA magic wand is about 40 cm long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.\n\n#### Weapons\n\nWhether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.\n\nSome magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\n\n#### Wondrous Items\n\nWondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all category.\n\n\n\n"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Rarity","description":"Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, such as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created.\n\nThus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities. Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items.\n\nIf your campaign allows for trade in magic items, rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, you determine the value of an individual magic item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Equipment section."},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic Items","title":"Wearing and Wielding Items","description":"Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.\n\nRare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.\n\n#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.\n\n#### Paired Items\n\nItems that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either item."}]},{"title":"What is a Spell","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Cantrips","description":"<p>\n  A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance.

A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Known and Prepared Spells","description":"<p>\n  Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Rituals","description":"<p>\n  Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Spell Level","description":"<p>\n  Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"Spell Slots","description":"<p>\n  Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h5>\n<p>\n  When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"What is a Spell","title":"What is a Spell","description":"<p>\n  A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten.

Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Casting a Spell","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Casting a Spell","title":"Casting a Spell","description":"<p>\n  When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Casting in Armor</h5>\n<p>\n  Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h4>Casting Time</h4>\n<p>\n  Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n</p>\n<h5>Bonus Action</h5>\n<p>\n  A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n</p>\n<h5>Reactions</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n</p>\n<h5>Longer Casting Times</h5>\n<p>\n  Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>\n  The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. A few spells that rely on weapons or material components held in your hand may have a range equal to your reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spells range is equal to touch, you must be within your unarmed reach of the creature (typically 1m for a medium or smaller creature) and have a hand free to touch the target. If a spell has a range of reach the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding the material component required by the spell. For example, if the spell has a material component of a weapon (such as booming blade) the range of the spell is equal to your reach when wielding that weapon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\").\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h4>Components</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n</p>\n<h5>Verbal (V)</h5>\n<p>\n  Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n</p>\n<h5>Somatic (S)</h5>\n<p>\n  Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. This can be the same hand used to hold a material component or spellcasting focus.\n</p>\n<h5>Material (M)</h5>\n<p>\n  Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n</p>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>\n  A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n</p>\n<h5>Instantaneous</h5>\n<p>\n  Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n</p>\n<h5>Concentration</h5>\n<p>\n  Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n  <li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source o f damage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n</p>\n<h4>Targets</h4>\n<p>\n  A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it w as targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>A Clear Path to the Target</h5>\n<p>\n  To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n</p>\n<h5>Targeting Yourself</h5>\n<p>\n  If a spell targets a creature o f your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect o f a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\n</p>\n<h4>Areas of Effect</h4>\n<p>\n  Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes                              : cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n</p>\n<h5>Cone</h5>\n<p>\n  A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cube</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Cylinder</h5>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h5>Line</h5>\n<p>\n  A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n</p>\n<h5>Sphere</h5>\n<p>\n  You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in meters that extends from the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.\n</p>\n<h4>Saving Throws</h4>\n<p>\n  Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\n</p>\n<h4>Attack Rolls</h4>\n<p>\n  Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within the reach of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.\n</p>\n<h4>Combining Magical Effects</h4>\n<p>\n  The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.\n</p>\n"}]},{"title":"Magic in Elthelas","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic in Elthelas","title":"Forces of Magic","description":"<p>\n  In our world we are familiar with the 4 fundamental forces.  The strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force.  These forces account for everything in our universe.  In the universe of Elthelas and D&amp;D there are additional forces that act on the universe, namely, the divine force, and the arcane force.\n</p>\n<h4>The Arcane Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The arcane force is emitted by arcanum, a rare material that is in fact a unique subatomic particle that is attracted to itself, and reacts to intentionality (a manifestation of the divine force) by emitting forces of its own on standard matter.  Most of the universes arcanum is noninteractive, and forms a barrier between the many \"planes\" of existence.  It is theorized that in ancient days the Gods built these walls of Arcanum to create greater order in the universe by separating arcanum from ordinary matter, allowing the divine force to act without causing unpredictable side effects.  However, philosophers have postulated that this theory may have a fundamental flaw, as the large collection of divine force necessary to form a God would have created massive chain reactions in a universe where Arcanum was more evenly distributed, likely dispersing the divine force in the process.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most accessible arcanum in the universe is found in crystal-like deposits.  Sometimes these deposits are buried in rock, sometimes they are free-floating, and on occasion they even fall from space.  Gravity appears to act on the deposits normally, but the other forces can have unpredictable results on a deposit of Arcanum.  Wizards have learned how to focus their divine soul to interact with arcanum deposits to produce predictable results, typically through a series of spoken chants and gestures, and sometimes by introducing other forms of matter that the arcane force can act on. The ability to produce increasingly powerful effects requires increasingly large deposits of arcanum (although it is not consumed in the process) however, repeated use of an arcanum crystal attracts free particles of arcanum, incrementally increasing the size of the crystal, and allowing more powerful magic to be cast with it (in game this is represented through a wizard or other arcane casters experience level).  Certain creatures and people have arcanum in their blood (such as dragons and sorcerers) this allows them to produce magical effects without an outside source of arcanum, but because they cannot inscribe on the arcanum, the number of effects they are able to produce is limited by the power of their divine spark. It is common practice among the bardic colleges to artificially infuse the blood with a small amount of arcanum so that the student can produce effects to dazzle and awe their audiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because Arcanum is self-attractive, events of massive magical significance can cause arcanum to congregate in a particular area. This leaves the area prone to strange occurrances. Occasionally some of the arcanum attracted leaks from the planar boundaries themselves, introducing new raw arcanum to the material plane, and a weak point into the boundary between worlds, often manifested as a portal or through the random passing back and forth of creatures between planes at that location.\n</p>\n<h4>The Divine Force</h4>\n<p>\n  The divine force is the manifestation of life itself, and can be generative or destructive, manifested in positive and negative energy.  The divine force has a unique ability to interact with organic compounds, causing them to react in a predictable (though complex) manner.  Every living thing is endowed with a certain amount of divine force.  The Gods are beings endowed with massive amounts of divine force.  The divine force is self-replenishing with time, such that creatures that use the divine force to produce some effect are drained for a time, but gain it back.  The divine force can also be granted to others (with training) although this weakens the one who grants it slightly.  Most mortals would die if they gave away their divine force, however, Gods give it to their chosen clerics and paladins regularly.  Druids and rangers draw divine force in small amounts from living things around them in the world, such as plants and animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Both the negative and positive divine forces can be used to grant or destroy life, however they naturally repel one another. Further, it has been found that whether ones soul acts with the negative or positive force is determined by the sorts of things one does.  This has created the natural 'good', 'evil' dichotomy in the universe, as those who choose 'evil' acts emit a force that is naturally repulsive towards those who commit 'good' acts, however in most cases the force is too weak to act at any distance from the individual, and thus this repulsion is undetectable by normal means.\n</p>"},{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Magic in Elthelas","title":"Schools of Magic","description":"<h4>Abjuration</h4>\n<p>\n  Abjuration is the use of the arcane or divine force to create barriers. This includes creating and restoring the barriers between the planes, which includes banishment effects.  Dispelling effects and anti-magic fields are fields that remove or dampen the effects of arcanum or the divine spark, usually by creating a barrier that emits the dampening force that moves outward.\n</p>\n<h4>Conjuration</h4>\n<p>\n  Conjuration magic is the use of one of the forces to pierce the planar barriers and, usually, bring something across the gap. This can be anything from energy (such as in an orb of fire spell) to a living creature, to small amounts of divine force (such as in healing spells).\n</p>\n<h4>Divination</h4>\n<p>\n  Divination magic is the use of the forces to transmit energy over great distances, the energy transmitted can usually only be very small, and thus it is typically used for observational purposes.\n</p>\n<h4>Enchantment</h4>\n<p>\n  Enchantment is the use of the forces to manipulate the minds of others.  This is a delicate and difficult process, and often can only be done in broad strokes.  However, most good societies consider the use of enchantment magic on unwilling individuals to be a violation of personal freedom, and additionally it can leave lasting, and sometimes unpredictable, side effects.\n</p>\n<h4>Evocation</h4>\n<p>\n  Evocation is the direct application of arcane or divine force, sometimes to create other energy effects, and sometimes to simply apply force directly.\n</p>\n<h4>Illusion</h4>\n<p>\n  Illusion is the use of arcane or divine force to manipulate sound waves, light, and sometimes even smell.  It is a school that often requires a great deal of skill and finesse, but not necessarily a lot of power.\n</p>\n<h4>Necromancy</h4>\n<p>\n  Necromancy is an attempt to transfer the divine force from one creature to another, to animate non-living creatures, or tap directly into the positive and negative energy planes.\n</p>\n<h4>Transmutation</h4>\n<p>\n  Transmutation is the use of arcane or divine force to actively alter physical forms or infuse them with energy.  It is usually a temporary effect as it is very difficult to overcome a living objects morphic resonance (a manifestation of the divine force that remembers a natural form, this is why healing spells infuse a person with a small amount of additional divine force, it strengthens their morphic resonance allowing them to heal faster).\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Wild Magic","rules":[{"category":"Magic","subcategory":"Wild Magic","title":"Wild Magic Table","description":"Certain class features require you to roll a wild magic surge.

If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20.

If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>\n<p>\n  Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\n</p>\n<h4>Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclassing Proficiencies</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Proficiencies Gained</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Artificer</td><td>light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Bard</td><td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Druid</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Factotum</td><td>Light armor, shields, one skill of your choice</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Monk</td><td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Light armor, simple weapons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wizard</td><td>-</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Class Features</h4>\n<p>\n  When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\n</p>\n<h5>Channel Divinity</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\n</p>\n<h5>Extra Attack</h5>\n<p>\n  If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\n</p>\n<h5>Unarmored Defense</h5>\n<p>\n  If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.\n</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting</h5>\n<p>\n  Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\n</p>\n<h5>Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level</h5>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>3rd</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>4th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>5th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>7th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>8th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>9th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"},{"category":"Other Rules","subcategory":"Leveling Up","title":"Proficiency Bonus","description":"<p>\n  Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level.

Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean.

It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment--the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\n</p>"}]}]},{"title":"Alignment","subcategories":[{"title":"Alignment","rules":[{"category":"Alignment","subcategory":"Alignment","title":"Alignment in the Multiverse","description":"<p>\n  For most thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\n</p>\n<h4>Sample Diseases</h4>\n<p>\n  The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\n</p>\n<h5>Cackle Fever</h5>\n<p>\n  This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the shrieks.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any event that causes the infected creature great stress--including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 3m of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\n</p>\n<h5>Sewer Plague</h5>\n<p>\n  Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\n</p>\n<h5>Sight Rot</h5>\n<p>\n  This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Legendary Creatures","rules":[{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Legendary Creatures","title":"Legendary Creatures","description":"<p>\n  A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't.

Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Challenge","description":"<p>\n  A monster's challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle.

The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time.

The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Tremorsense</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, have this special sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Truesight</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.\n</p>\n<p>\n  An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate spell, but the spell has a \"self only\" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher. The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list.

A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.\n</p>"},{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Monster Rules","title":"Types","description":"<p>\n  A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, and slaadi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n</p>\n  <h5>Tags</h5>\n<p>\n  A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Non-Player Characters","rules":[{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Non-Player Characters","title":"Non-Player Characters","description":"<p>\n  There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs for your home campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Racial Traits.</strong> You can add racial traits to an NPC.

Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\n</p>\n<h4>Statistics for Objects</h4>\n<p>\n  When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Armor Class</strong> An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Substance</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Cloth, Paper, Rope</td><td>11</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Crystal, glass, ice</td><td>13</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>wood, bone</td><td>15</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Stone</td><td>17</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Iron, steel</td><td>19</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Mithral</td><td>21</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Adamantine</td><td>23</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hit Points.</strong> An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Fragile</th><th>Resilient</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td><td>2 (1d4)</td><td>5 (2d4)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Small (chest, lute)</td><td>3 (1d6)</td><td>10 (3d6)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td><td>4 (1d8)</td><td>18 (4d8)</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Large (Cart)</td><td>5 (1d10)</td><td>27 (5d10)</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n  <strong>Huge and Gargantuan Objects.</strong> Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Objects and Damage Types.</strong> Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Damage Threshold.</strong> Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Poisons","rules":[{"category":"GM Rules","subcategory":"Poisons","title":"Poisons","description":"<p>\n  Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, draw, and other evil creatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Poisons come in the following four types.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Contact.</strong> A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects.

Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\n</p>\n<h5>Crafting</h5>\n<p>\n  You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 10 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 10 gp, you make progress every day in 10-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 150 days to craft by yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\n</p>\n<h5>Practicing a Profession</h5>\n<p>\n  You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day.

Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\n</p>\n<h5>Training</h5>\n<p>\n  You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Between Adventures","title":"Lifestyle Expenses","description":"<p>\n  Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead><tr><th>Lifestyle</th><th>Price/Day</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Wretched</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Squalid</td><td>1 sp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Poor</td><td>2 sp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Modest</td><td>1 gp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>2 gp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>4 gp</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>10 gp minimum</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p>\n<p><strong>Squalid.</strong> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Modest.</strong> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Comfortable.</strong> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Aristocratic.</strong> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\n</p>\n<h5>Self-Sufficiency</h5>\n<p>\n  The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford--paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\n</p>\n<h4>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h4>\n<p>\n  The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging.

The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you fall in combat, it happens immediately on the turn in which the fall begins, up to 150m If you are still falling at that point, you descend an additional 150m at the end of your next turn unless something causes the fall to end (such as being caught, beginning to fly, or hitting the ground).\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Environment","title":"Food, Water, and Sleep","description":"<p>\n  Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\n</p>\n<h5>Food</h5>\n<p>\n  A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\n</p>\n<h5>Water</h5>\n<p>\n  A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\n</p>\n<h5>Sleep</h5>\n<p>\n  Most creatures, including player characters, require regular sleep. If your character does not get at least 6 hours of sleep in a day (usually performed as part of a long rest), they suffer one level of exhaustion.\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Environment","title":"Interacting with Objects","description":"<p>\n  A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Environment","title":"Suffocating","description":"<p>\n  A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\n</p>"},{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Environment","title":"Vision and Light","description":"<p>\n  The most fundamental tasks of adventuring--noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few--rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A heavily obscured area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\n</p>\n  <h5>Blindsight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\n</p>\n<h5>Darkvision</h5>\n<p>\n  Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n</p>\n<h5>Truesight</h5>\n<p>\n  A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n</p>"}]},{"title":"Resting","rules":[{"category":"Adventuring","subcategory":"Resting","title":"Long Rest","description":"<p>\n  A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours.

At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\n</p>\n<h4>Jumping</h4>\n<p>\n  Your Strength determines how far you can jump.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Long Jump.</strong> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to 1/3 your Strength score if you move at least 3m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet.

When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump.

The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Forced March.</strong> The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n</p>\n<table class=\"table table-sm\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th>Pace</th><th>Distance per Minute</th><th>Distance per Hour</th><th>Distance per Day</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td>Fast</td><td>120m</td><td>7km</td><td>56km</td><td>-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Normal</td><td>90m</td><td>5km</td><td>40km</td><td>-</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Slow</td><td>60m</td><td>3.5km</td><td>28km</td><td>Able to Use Stealth</td></tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>\n<p>\n  The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors.
