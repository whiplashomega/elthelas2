It is an ancient name for the place of legend where the orc race was first created. Whether that was actually the huge black mountain called Dal Okra today is a question for debate, as that history was lost in the God's War. Dal Okra today is a huge empty tomb, once holding the Prince of Fiends, a believed dead Sorceron, who once commanded at least part of the orc legions in the God's War before he was struck down by Michael, the Archangel of Alohim. Now he is awake again, and has taken nearly complete control of the orcish tribes.","coords":[39.07091222166154,53.38964866413321]},{"name":"Dera","description":"Once the capital of the Deran empire, now an ancient ruin destroyed by demons.

The mountain is home to an extensive system of natural caves, which they have greatly enlarged, and several cool springs that supply an abundance of water. As such it serves as trading post and wintering location for the Sand Orcs. It is also the location their chiefs meet in order to discuss any matters that involve all of the tribes. It is a place of peace, and no sand orc is allowed to raise a hand against another while at or near Fang.","coords":[-12.113851416311437,76.56316743480217]},{"name":"Fortress of Light","description":"The Fortress of Light is a massive joint venture defensive fortress and staging facility manned by dwarves, humans, and elves from Gerasalim, Dormania, Kandor, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran. It is the central supply dump and gathering point for campaigns and troop movements in the defense against attacking orcs, trolls, gnolls, and various goblinoids coming across arid plain known as the Blighted Gap.\n\nThe fortress itself is built surrounding a small springfed lake, and covers nearly 3 square miles. It's outer wall extend up 150 feet of sheer stone braced with adamantium, without joint or crack, and they are nearly 15 foot thick. Several large inner keeps, built similarly to the outer wall, extend up some 200-250 feet. Large counterspelling crystals instantly counter any spell cast at or near the fortress. A dry moat, filled with thick steel spikes, extends out 25 feet from the edge of the wall.\n\nAfter the second fall of Aridhem, and the withdrawal of elven and dormanian armies, the Fortress of Light found itself without sufficient soldiers to man the walls, and cut off from resupply. It took only a month for the orcs to breach the walls and take the fortress after that point. Although the defenders inflicted massive casualties on the orcs, they were slaughtered to a man.\n\nNow the Fortress is the forward base of orcish operations in the north.","coords":[47.7619452898863,61.0426659032797]},{"name":"Gaia's Grove","description":"The Dreaming Goddess, Gaia, Who Dreams No More. Such is the line the druids have told in recent months, encouraging pilgrims to come to the wild island of Gnarra to see the hidden grove where Gaia, until recently, slept. About 20 miles in from the south coast of Gnarra the grove is guarded by the Faelin, who speak little about the events that led to the Goddess awakening, only saying she was 'saved' by a group of adventurers and a mighty druid. No one will say what she was saved from.\n\nThe grove itself has only 1 small entrance, with no other path through the tangle of branches and trees that form an impenetrable dome around the living altar.","coords":[7.821207944438957,-19.231166909790158]},{"name":"God Spire","description":"The God Spire is a relic of the age before the God's War located in north central Eldoran.

It was a massive public works project that employed nearly 300,000 people during a period of relative peace for the Empire and construction took 23 years.\n\nDorman III began construction in 1524 after his requests for aid from the college during the Nerim Cataclysm took months to arrive.  When he died in battle against the orcs in 1530 his brother, Dorman IV took the throne and continued the project.  Shortly after its completion Dorman IV died of an apparent heart attack.","coords":[56.68678531418071,97.00171078934666]},{"name":"Iron Triangle","description":"The Iron Triangle is three fortresses built equidistant from each other in northeast Nerim, each about half a mile from the other two.

The unwalled and poorly defended city, far from the war fronts the orcs were used to fighting on, was quickly overrun. Those who did not escape were killed, and while the undead were driven back and eventually destroyed, the Champions of Cora who led the charge felt no pity for the Mat'raktha worshipping orcs, and bypassed the city on their way to Nerim. The city remains a nest of the undead to this day.","coords":[31.448581865293658,81.98434178204676]},{"name":"Sorcerer's Prison","description":"The Sorcerer's Prison is believed to be the single greatest work of magic since the God's War.
