To randomly determine a height and weight for your character first start with height. Roll the dice indicated, and write down the result. Then add the result to the base height. This is your characters height in inches. To determine the weight, roll the dice indicated under weightroll. Take the result, multiply it by your result from the height roll and then add it to the base weight. This is your characters weight in pounds. So for example, say a protector Aasimar character rolls 2d10 on their height roll and gets a 12. She adds that to the base height of 58 and gets a height of 70 inches (or 5'10\"). Next she rolls the weight roll, 2d4, and gets a 4. She multiplies this by her height roll of 12 to get a result of 48, which she then adds to the base weight (120) to get a total weight of 168 lbs.

First look at the height roll and imagine what the lowest and highest numbers you could roll would be. For our Protector Aasimar example the minimum would be 2, and the maximum would be 20. This gives a range of 60 inches - 78 inches or 5'0\" - 6'6\". She picks a number she feels is appropriate for her character that falls within that range, say 5'7\", which would be a roll of 9. She then can use that to determine what an appropriate possible weight would be. 2d4 has results ranging from 2 - 8. So the minimum would be 2 * 9 + 120, or 138 lbs, while the maximum would be 8 * 9 + 120, or 192 lbs.
