Joining a faction comes with responsibilities, risks, and rewards, as well as the potential to gain ranks and influence. Whenever players complete work on behalf of a faction, the DM may award disposition points to the players completing the work. If you are not actually part of the faction you cannot have more than 5 disposition points with a faction. Each faction has a number of ranks (listed in the faction description). Gaining a new rank requires a certain mimimum disposition, as well as other requirements the DM might set. Once a rank is achieved, the players gain certain benefits.
