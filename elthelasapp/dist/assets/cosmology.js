Thus, planes being adjacent is simply describing that there is only one barrier between them. Since cutting through multiple planar barriers at once requires exponentially more energy, planar travel typically requires movement through adjacent planes. </p><div data-v-19710910><img src="https://elthelas-images.herokuapp.com/maps/elthelas-planar-map.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="A map of the Planes of Elthelas" data-v-19710910><p data-v-19710910> Map image courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/sethscheib" data-v-19710910>Seth Scheib</a>, Art by Chyna Schut </p></div><h3 data-v-19710910>The Planes of Creation</h3><p data-v-19710910> These are the planes derived from the essence of Gaian, the heart of creation.

The climb involves a series of trials that measure the enlightenment of the individual.

Their shared palace is dominated by a great arena, where their latest aquisitions battle in brutal blood sport. However, death on this plane is not release, rather those who die here are reborn, their minds slowly becoming more and more dominated by hatred and a lust for blood, until each continually craves their next chance in the arena so that they can wreak havoc once again. </p><h4 data-v-19710910>Morbustos</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Ganarea</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Palusectum</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Serangga</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Hiemsal</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Frosti</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Domigarus</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Kamin</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Niktos</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Dorman</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Kolasdrag</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Tiamat</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Chaus Prima</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Malik</p><p data-v-19710910></p><h4 data-v-19710910>Praetorium Eterni</h4><p data-v-19710910><strong data-v-19710910>Home of: </strong> Cora</p><p data-v-19710910></p>',142),r=[n];function h(d,i,p,l,v,m){return a(),e("div",null,r)}var c=o(s,[["render",h],["__scopeId","data-v-19710910"]]);export{c as default};
