Thus, planes being adjacent is simply describing that there is only one barrier between them. Since cutting through multiple planar barriers at once requires exponentially more energy, planar travel typically requires movement through adjacent planes. </p><div data-v-bb2bc7ce><img src="https://elthelas-images.herokuapp.com/maps/elthelas-planar-map.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="A map of the Planes of Elthelas" data-v-bb2bc7ce><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> Map image courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/sethscheib" data-v-bb2bc7ce>Seth Scheib</a>, Art by Chyna Schut </p></div><h3 data-v-bb2bc7ce>The Planes of Creation</h3><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> These are the planes derived from the essence of Gaian, the heart of creation. The geography of each of these planes is mirrored between them, the root of which is the Material, and all the others being reflections of that. </p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Elthelas, the Material Plane</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Gaian</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> The central plane of creation, home of Gaian and the place where physics behaves most like you or I would expect. </p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Etherium, or the Ethereal Plane</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Mystikinae</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> The Etherium is a hazy reflection of the material plane, where distances and time are not absolute, and it is almost impossible to navigate.

It is said nothing exists that does not have its perfected form in Logos. Logos is separated into 4 sections, at the center of which is the Confluence, An island on which Nera&#39;s palace sits. The four quadrants around it are the Negative Energy Sea, which flows from Necronus; the Positive Energy Sea, which flows from Celestia; The Plains of Stillness, containing the road to Mechanus, and The Seas of Chance, a chaotic realm that flows out from Mercuria.</p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Celestia</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Alohim, Amathera</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> A realm of peace and rest, Celestia serves as the source of radiant light. No shadows exist in Celestia, and it is eternally daytime. It is dominated by the massive Mount Celestia, whose slopes cannot be measured but instead measure the worth of a man. </p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> The base of the mountain is dominated by the City of the Righteous, a place of kindness and giving that is the home of Amathera. There she travels from home to home, and ensures that all are able to enjoy the peace of Celestia. </p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> Those who achieved greatness in their lives are encouraged to attempt the climb up the mountain, at the top of which is the Shining Palace of Alohim. The climb involves a series of trials that measure the enlightenment of the individual. Should the person undertaking the journey fail, they may climb forever without reaching the top, but for the truly enlightened, the journey passes nearly instantaneously, as they ascend the final steps to bask in Alohim&#39;s light and share in his rulership of the cosmos. </p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Skoteivas</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Mat&#39;raktha</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>The 9 Hells</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Asmodeus</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Dracinium</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Indra, Bahamut</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Mechanus</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Tock</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Eternium</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Chronos</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Gallaria Perfectum</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Adonna</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Astral Sea</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Maris</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Poetica Melodium</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Bragi</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Mercuria</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Labious</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Chakaria</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Moira</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Mirrodeum</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Alithia</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>The Abyss</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Ba&#39;al</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Necronus</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Ptoma</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><hr data-v-bb2bc7ce><h3 data-v-bb2bc7ce>The Planes of Effect</h3><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Aitia</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Area</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Nephelheim</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Annam, Trolka</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> The home of the Giant Gods, Nephelheim is surprisingly varied in its appearance across its face. Most of it is a cold, frozen tundra where the sun does not shine, but with pockets of cold marshlands and dotted with fiery volcanoes. Cities filled with the souls of giants, trolls, and giant kin dot the landscape as well. In this place the Ordning is the absolute law, and everyone and everything knows its place in the heirarchy of strength. </p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Temerus</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Fanome, Arengesus</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>The Nothingness Beyond</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Zhuul</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce>Where the Far Realm is a land full of madness beyond comprehension, aberrations, and beings beyond the comprehension of mortals, the nothingness beyond is a great empty space. A void where nothing at all can survive. Zhuul embodies this concept of nothingness, and as such has no real home on this plane, but rather encompasses all of it, and none of it. For he is nothingness, and The Nothingness Beyond contains nothing.</p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>The Far Realm</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Fa&#39;atasi</p> A realm of twisted minds, madness, and beings beyond the comprehension of mortals. Ocassionally a being from here will become interested in the mortal realm and reach out to touch mortal minds. These beings take many forms and titles, and their interests do not align with anything in particular besides their own curiosity, but those touched by them invariably suffer insanities that put them beyond the mortal. <p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Sanguinus</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Vrasja, Odio</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce> The realm of blood, ruled by Vrasja and her daughter Odio. This realm is dominated by creatures bent on murder and hatred, both of mortals, and each other. Unlike many of the dark gods, Vrasja and Odio have never sought to expand their influence, but instead take great delight in twisting the minds of mortals against each other, and thus drawing more murderous, hateful souls into their grasp. Their shared palace is dominated by a great arena, where their latest aquisitions battle in brutal blood sport. However, death on this plane is not release, rather those who die here are reborn, their minds slowly becoming more and more dominated by hatred and a lust for blood, until each continually craves their next chance in the arena so that they can wreak havoc once again. </p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Morbustos</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Ganarea</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Palusectum</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Serangga</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Hiemsal</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Frosti</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Domigarus</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Kamin</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Niktos</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Dorman</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Kolasdrag</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Tiamat</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Chaus Prima</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Malik</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p><h4 data-v-bb2bc7ce>Praetorium Eterni</h4><p data-v-bb2bc7ce><strong data-v-bb2bc7ce>Home of: </strong> Cora</p><p data-v-bb2bc7ce></p>',142),s=[c];function n(r,h,d,i,p,l){return a(),t("div",null,s)}var m=e(o,[["render",n],["__scopeId","data-v-bb2bc7ce"]]);export{m as default};
