Gravity appears to act on the deposits normally, but the other forces can have unpredictable results on a deposit of Arcanum. Wizards have learned how to focus their divine soul to interact with arcanum deposits to produce predictable results, typically through a series of spoken chants and gestures, and sometimes by introducing other forms of matter that the arcane force can act on. The ability to produce increasingly powerful effects requires increasingly large deposits of arcanum (although it is not consumed in the process) however, repeated use of an arcanum crystal attracts free particles of arcanum, incrementally increasing the size of the crystal, and allowing more powerful magic to be cast with it (in game this is represented through a wizard or other arcane casters experience level). Certain creatures and people have arcanum in their blood (such as dragons and sorcerers) this allows them to produce magical effects without an outside source of arcanum, but because they cannot inscribe on the arcanum, the number of effects they are able to produce is limited by the power of their divine spark. It is common practice among the bardic colleges to artificially infuse the blood with a small amount of arcanum so that the student can produce effects to dazzle and awe their audiences.
