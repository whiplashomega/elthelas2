  <h2 id="ranger">Ranger</h2>
  <p>Changes are <strong>In Bold</strong></p>
  <h4>Favored Enemy</h4>
  <p>
    Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience
    studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain
    type of enemy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations,
    beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey,
    fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.
    Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid
    (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to
    track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence
    checks to recall information about them.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    When you hit one of your favored enemies with a weapon attack you do
    additional damage equal to your wisdom modifier.
  </strong></p>
  <p>
    When you gain this feature, you also learn one
    language of your choice that is spoken by your favored
    enemies, if they speak one at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as
    an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you
    gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of
    monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
  </p>

  <h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating
    camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh
    mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring
    materials with which to create your camouflage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try
    to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface,
    such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide
    as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth)
    checks.  <strike>as long as you remain there without moving or
    taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a
    reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain
    this benefit.</strike><strong>Once you move more than 100 ft from your original location,
    or the terrain you are in changes you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</strong>
  </p>
  <h4>Foe Slayer</h4>
  <p>
    At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your
    enemies. <strike>Once on each of your turns, you can add your
    Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of
    an attack you make against one of your favored enemies.</strike>
    <strong>When you attack your favored enemy you can add your proficiency bonus to all weapon damage rolls
    against your favored enemy, and your wisdom bonus to your attack rolls.</strong>
    You can choose to use this feature before or after the
    roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
  </p>
  <h4>Ranger's Companion</h4>
  <p>
    At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that
    accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to
    fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than
    Medium and that has a challenge rating of <strong>1/2 or your ranger level divided by 6, rounded down</strong> or lower
    (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff,
    and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus
    to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skills it is proficient in.
    <strong>For saving throws it uses its own bonus or your bonus, whichever is greater</strong>.
    Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or <strong>six
    times your ranger level</strong>, whichever is higher.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It
    takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an
    action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can
    verbally command the beast where to move (no action
    required by you). You can use your <strong>bonus action</strong> to verbally
    command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge,
    or Help action. <strike>Once you have the Extra Attack feature,
    you can make one weapon attack yourself when you
    command the beast to take the Attack action.</strike>
  </p>
  <p>
    While traveling through your favored terrain with only
    the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by
    spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast
    that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type o f beast as
    before or a different one.
  </p>
  <h2 id="barbarian">Barbarian</h2>
  <h4>Rage</h4>
  <p>
    In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
    you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
  </p>
  <p>
    While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
    aren’t wearing heavy armor:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
      saving throws.</li>
    <li>
      When you make a melee weapon attack using
      Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
      increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, <strike>as shown
      in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</strike>
      <strong>Equal to 2 times your proficiency bonus.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
      slashing damage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
    concentrate on them while raging.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
    knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
    haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
    or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
    on your turn as a bonus action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have raged the number of times shown
    for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
    Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
    can rage again.
  </p>
  <h2 id="factotum">Factotum</h2>
  <p>
    The Factotum is the ultimate seeker of knowledge.  A student of
    all schools, the Factotum seeks any kind of knowledge, and uses everything
    she learns to her advantage.  Her constant study allows the Factotum to
    display flashes of inspiration, filling any role necessary, if only for
    a short time.  The Factotum is nothing if not versatile, although
    occasionally unfocused.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above all, the Factotum is prepared for anything, any circumstance and any challenge, at least when
    they manage to make it out of the library.  While the Factotum's focus on learning new things is
    similar to the wizard's focus on arcane knowledge, the Factotum does not share the Wizard's focus.
    The Factotum is just as interested in that tome on arcane combat styles, or the architects detailed
    schematics as that previously unknown spell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Factotum's as civilians often work as librarians, scientists, or advisors to people of power.  As adventurers
    they travel the world seeking out stores of hidden knowledge, documenting unusual creatures, learning from reclusive
    masters of various arts and skills, or just meeting unusual people, enjoying foods they could never experience at home,
    and seeing the sights.  In all of their doings they have a talent for coming up with the solution no one else thought of,
    and with a flash of inspiration, snatching victory and success from the jaws of failure and defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans and half-elves are the most common factotums, followed by halflings
    and gnomes.

    You can spend an inspiration point when making any skill check to add
    your intelligence bonus to the check.

  <h4>Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 1st level, you can spend inspiration points to cast
    spells.  You know cantrips and spells according to the factotum
    table, and can learn any spell from any classes spell list as long as
    you are able to learn spells of that level.  Intelligence is your
    spellcasting ability for these spells.  You can cast a cantrip as long as
    you have an inspiration point to spend on it, and a spell of a higher
    level as long as you have sufficient inspiration points to cast it,
    and a spell slot remaining.  Casting a spell costs a number of
    inspiration points equal to 1 + the spells level.
  </p>

  <p>

    making an attack roll to add your intelligence bonus to the attack
    roll.

  </p>
  <h4>Inspired Recovery</h4>
  <p>
    At 20th level you no longer require a short rest to regain your
    inspiration points, but can do so by spending 10 minutes reading and
    studying your books and materials.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Factotum Philosophies</h3>
  
  
  <h3>Brains Over Brawn</h3>
  
  
  <p>
    Those who follow the Brains over Brawn philosophy have focused their studies on the weaknesses
    of their potential enemies, taking the idea of knowledge as power into the field of combat. These
    scholars always seem to know their enemies weaknesses, and can use that knowledge to get around
    their defenses.
  </p>
  <h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 3rd level, you can spend a bonus action to study an
    opponent and discover how to get past its defenses.   When you use
    this ability pick a target, you can use your intelligence modifier
    instead of strength or dexterity on weapon attack rolls and damage
    rolls until the start of your next turn.
  </p>
  <h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 7th level, your knowledge of your opponents weaknesses allows you to strike with
    uncanny precision if you catch them off guard.  Once per round, when you successfully hit an opponent with an attack and that enemy
    is adjacent to an ally or you have advantage against them, you can
    spend 1 inspiration point to add 2d6 damage to the attack roll, this increases to 3d6 at 11th level,
    4d6 at 15th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.
  </p>
  <h4>Fighting Style Mimic</h4>
  <p>
    At 10th level the Brains over Brawn Factotum can pick one of the following fighting styles.  Whenever they finish a long rest they can
    spend 3 inspiration points to replace this fighting style with a different one from the list.  This ability does not stack with the fighting
    style granted by any other class.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Archery</strong> - You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
    <li><strong>Dueling</strong> - When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
        with that weapon.</li>
    <li><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong> - When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage
        of the second attack.</li>
    <li><strong>Great Weapon Fighting</strong> - When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
        make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
        roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
        this benefit.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Attack</h4>
  <p>
    At 15th level, when you use an inspiration point to add a bonus to
    your attack roll, you can make an additional attack as a bonus action,
    adding your intelligence modifier to both attacks.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Arcane Dilettante</h3>
  
  
  <p>
    The Arcane Dilettante has studied magic enough that they begin to seem less like
    their faking it, and more like a practiced wizard.  They no longer rely on bursts
    of inspiration for their most practiced spells, and can put together an idea of
    how to cast even unpracticed spells with less effort.
  </p>
  <h4>Improved Inspired Spellcasting</h4>
  <p>
    At 3rd level, the number of inspiration points you need to cast a
    spell is reduced by one, to a minimum of 0 for cantrips.  Also you can
    cast an additional 2 spells per day (in addition to the amount listed
    in the Factotum table) before requiring a long rest, and can cast higher level spells, use the table below instead of the Factotum table to determine
    the highest level of spell you can cast and your spells known.

  <h4>Additional Skill Proficiency</h4>
  <p>
    At 3rd level the arcane dilettante gains proficiency in the arcana skill.  If they were already proficient in the
    arcana skill they gain expertise in the arcana skill (can add their proficiency bonus twice).
  </p>
  <h4>Spell Study</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 7th level you have become a proficient enough spell
    caster that you can make a spell work with only minimal study.
    Starting when they gain this feature, the Factotum can add any spell
    they successfully observe being cast to a spell journal.  In order to successfully add it to their spell journal the following conditions
    must be met:
    <ul>
      <li>The spell must be of a level the Factotum can cast.</li>
      <li>
        The Factotum must be able to see(if it has somatic/material components) and hear(if it has a verbal component)
        the spell being cast.
      </li>
      <li>
        They then must succeed on an intelligence (arcana) check with a DC equal to 15 + the spells level at the time the spell is cast.
        If they fail this check they can try again only if they observe the spell being cast again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>    
      The Factotum can, in addition to their normal spells known, prepare 1 spell from their spell journal.  Whenever you regain your spent
      inspiration points you can change what spell you have prepared.
    </p>
  </p>
  <h4>Cantrip Master</h4>
  <p>
    Starting at 10th level, whenever The Factotum finishes a long rest they can trade out one cantrip you know for a different cantrip that they have
    successfully recorded to their spell journal.
  </p>
  <h4>Sage</h4>
  <p>

    instead of a long rest.

    kits if they are not already proficient.
  </p>
  <h4>Everday Illusions</h4>
  <p>
    At level 3, when you take this philosophy, the factotum learns the minor illusion cantrip in addition to their normal
    cantrips known, and can cast it without spending an inspiration point.
  </p>
  <h4>Hide in the Crowd</h4>
  <p>

    weapons except psychic.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Mentalities</h3>
  <p>
    A Scourer's journey begins with a certain mentality in mind. Do you despise all magic and wish to rid the world of its corrupting evils? Or do you
    fight fire with fire and use your own magic to nullify others?
  </p>
  
  <h3>Mage Slayer</h3>
  
  <h4>Slay Magic</h4>

    higher level spells require a dexterity check with the DC being 10 + the spells level. If you succeed, you can choose to negate the spell entirely, or
    if the spell targets a single target other than the caster, you can choose a different target for the spell. If the spell is a concentration spell,
    you take over concentration for the spells duration if you choose to do so. You may only concentrate on one spell at a time. This effect increases to
    three at 9th level and four at 14th level.
  </p>
