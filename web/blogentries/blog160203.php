    Not a lot to say today except that you should check out the <a href="https://elthelas.com/history/current">Current Events</a> page.  I've updated
    that page as well as the <a href="https://elthelas.com/history/timeline">Timeline of Major Events</a> to reflect recent occurances in the core
    campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also made a quick styling fix on the classes page, fixed an error on the domains page, and added the fire domain (homebrew domain) to the
    appropriate Gods (Bahamut and Molton).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally I added descriptions for Ochre'Ken and Desadorel to the geography pages, as well as updating Sunra, Gulutheim, and Marinda to take
    into account current events.
