  <p>
    First off, I'd like to mention that the non-player race descriptions have been finished*.  With this the races page should be done
    for the relatively long term.**  This means that DMs should have everything they need to create interesting goblin, hobgoblin, bugbear, gnoll,
    kobold, or lizardfolk NPCs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, and perhaps more interestingly, I have added a new playable class, the Factotum.  This is purely homebrew, and it is of course a DMs
    prerogative if they want to include it in their campaign.  Nevertheless I feel I have managed to keep it reasonably balanced for player use,
    while maintaining the spirit of the old 3.5 Factotum.  It was developed at the specific request of my wife, because she was obsessed with the
    old 3.5 Factotum class, and was very sad that it wasn't included in 5th edition.  There is an overlap of terms, because Factotums have a feature
    called 'Inspiration Points' that functions entirely differently from the 'Inspiration' feature as defined in the PHB.  If it bugs you, call them
    something else.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upcoming work will likely focus on expanded descriptions for individual cities, as well as updating the timeline of events to include things
    taking place in my own "canon" campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
    *barring discovery of errors, and potentially with more "fluff" text added later.
  </p>
  <p>
    **barring WOC releasing new races or subraces in future supplements that I decide to incorporate into the setting.
