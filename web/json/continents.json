{"model":"Continent","documents":[{"name":"Amatheran Ocean","description":"While some have theorized that the ocean west of Riftlan is the same as the ocean east of Dormania, no one has yet been able to prove that fact.  As such, they still maintain different names on the two continents.","contains":["Alfadir","Zelfir"],"coords":[-70,-145]},{"name":"Atyrea","description":"Atyrea is the southern most known continent in Elthelas. It is connected by land bridge to the continent of Riftlan.\n\nAtyrea is the original home of the Staelic humans, a number of goliath tribes, and the Stagen gnomes. The hisru people migrated from Riftlan, displacing the native population in the northwestern plains, after a religious schism within their people. More recently orc colonists from Malinval carved a territory for themselves in the northeast, calling it sage.","contains":["Hisru'de'tan","Sage","Alfadir","Stagenheim","Staelia","Gorgro"],"coords":[-56,-82]},{"name":"Dragon Sea","description":"Sitting due east of the southern Dragonhome Mountains, the Dragon Sea can be perilous waters for the unprepared.  For that reason most sailors, skirt the Hisru coast as they move south, eventually putting into shore at Mandon, or possibly portaging over the Exodus Isthmus into the Mermaid Sea, and the rich Alfadiran port cities beyond.","contains":["Zelfir","Dragonhome","Hisru'de'tan"],"coords":[-37,-115]},{"name":"Eastern Ocean","description":"The Eastern Ocean lies to the east of Dormania, a vast expanse of ocean that to date no sailor has managed to cross and return. It is theorized that it wraps around the far side of the world until reaching Riftlan, empty and impassable.","contains":["Dormania","Nerim","Seran","Terron"],"coords":[55,174]},{"name":"Elathia","description":"Elathia is the largest and most heavily populated of the 3 known continents. It has been the home of great empires, and also of epic wars. It lies to the east of the other two major continents.","contains":["Dormania","Kandor","Gerasalim","Curinor","Demal'Thor","Eldoran","Arad","Malinval"],"coords":[20,90]},{"name":"Ice Ocean","description":"The far north of the world is covered in polar ice, spreading in the winter to block the northern ports of Kaland and Farengar, and receding in the summer.  This landless ocean has never been crossed.","contains":["Curinor","Dormania","Eldoran","Kandor"],"coords":[75,50]},{"name":"Mermaid Sea","description":"Comprising the oft-traversed bay between Zelfir and Alfadir, the mermaid sea links the two continents trade networks.  Civic planners have for years proposed building a massive canal to connect the mermaid sea to the dragon sea to the north of the Exodus Isthmus, but to date the Mage's Council has been unwilling to fund the effort, despite the promises of increased trade it would bring.","contains":["Zelfir","Alfadir"],"coords":[-58,-112]},{"name":"Riftlan","description":"Riftlan as a continent is largely uninhabited by humanoids, although not for lack of trying. The border between the material non-material planes is weak across most of the continent, particularly in the northern half, regularly allowing unusual and magical creatures to slip through. Encountering a stray demon tends to be catastrophic to your average farming community, making settlement on the continent difficult at best. The worst case is best exemplified by the destruction of Dera at the hands of a demonic army, the result of a portal opening in the northern mountains to the abyss. The resulting catastrophy required the intervention of a God to end, and though the portal is long closed, the remnants of that army still linger in the western mountains.","contains":["Dera","Dragonhome","Dera'Dragorim","Zelfir"],"coords":[-15,-145]},{"name":"South Sea","description":"The South Sea is the home of a number of large islands, a subcontinent, and is the almost exclusive domain of the Morrind trade fleets.
