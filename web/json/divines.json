Since the Gods War, Asmodeus has never again taken such an aggressive stance towards the world, his lawful nature forcing him to be bound to the agreement he made at the end of the war. Instead he seeks to gain souls and influence for his kingdom by making deals with other beings. He has been known to intervene more directly, however, when others break their agreements with him."},{"id":"azrael","name":"Azrael","alignment":"Neutral","home":"","type":"Angel","description":"Also called the Angel of Death, Azrael is a servant of Nera, often representing her darker aspect, but nevertheless maintaining her neutral stance in the world.

Ba'al is not truly the leader of the abyss, it is hard to rule a land of pure chaos and evil, but he is the closest there is to a single leader, in that no other Demon dares to challenge him. While technically a party to the Gods Agreement, Ba'al routinely ignores it, sending demons into the Material Plane whenever the opportunity presents itself. This has led to several major cataclysmic events on Elthelas, some recorded in history, and others not."},{"id":"barachiel","name":"Barachiel","alignment":"Neutral Good","home":"","type":"Angel","description":"The Angel Protector, Barachiel is the consort of Amathera, acting in her stead to defend the weak and lift up the downtrodden."},{"id":"bartholomew","name":"Bartholomew","alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","home":"","type":"Angel","description":"Known as the Avatar of Chaos, Bartholomew often appears as a little child. A 'servant' of the Chaos Gods--Malik, Molton, and Cora--he is tasked with disrupting the lawful order of the world (his 'servant' status is more a technicality than anything, tales tell that he rarely follows the expressed wishes of these Gods either, they have simply taken responsibility for him among the pantheon, protecting him from more severe retribution). He is involved with everything from starting rebellions to unpredictable natural disasters such as earthquakes. He is often reviled by the leaders of the more law-bent churches, such as those worshipping Alohim, Bahamut, Dorman, or even Mat'raktha, as many tales tell of how he has dashed the well laid plans of these Gods quests for order through power.\n\nA common way to curse someone is to give them the sign of Bartholomew, a drawing combining the holy symbols of the 3 Gods he serves, a banner all but consumed in flames over a compass rose of arrows."},{"id":"castael","name":"Castael","alignment":"Neutral","home":"","type":"Angel","description":"Castael, the watcher, is a servant of Nera, and is responsible for enforcing the Gods Agreement, his sword is rumored to be able to slay even a God.

'Me' could probably best be described as a sentient living plane (or potentially demi-plane) of existence. The existence of 'Me' is only known about due to a few magical accidents in which wizards of one sort or another found themselves on the plane of 'Me'. It isn't in fact clear if there is just one such plane, or if perhaps there are many. The name 'Me' stems mostly, it seems, from not having a name, or really understanding the concept of names, while still having an individual identity. The plane, when asked who it is, has been known to express confusion and repeat the statement, \"I am me.\"\n\nThe being was recently revealed to be the trapped Goddess Area, who refused the terms of the Gods Agreement and was thus imprisoned by the other Gods, stripped of form and trapped on a demiplane.  She briefly returned to the world only to be slain by the dagger of Nera, famed to be able to kill even a God.  Rumors that the demiplane she was entrapped upon still exists, and still bears the mark of her consciousness are so far unproven."},{"id":"mikael","name":"Mikael","alignment":"Chaotic Evil","home":"","type":"Fiend","description":"The Angel of Vengeance is more demon than angel.
