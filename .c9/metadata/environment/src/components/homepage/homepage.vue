Elthelas is a world of fantasy. It is full of strange creatures, wondrous places, dark evils, and grand ","\t\tadventures. In Elthelas Gods and magic are a part of day to day life. ","\t</p>","\t<p>","\t\tCompared to your average D&D setting, Elthelas is more civilized.  The world sits in a place like 14th-15th century Europe. While ","\t\tguns have yet to make their debut, gunpowder is in use by select groups. Nationalism is taking root.  Kings are able to enforce their ","\t\twill beyond the city or castle gates. Even the 'evil' races have started to settle down. The orcs have large cities and settlements ","\t\tthat are part of a large decentralized empire. The civilized races have pushed the remaining races to the wild places on the edges of ","\t\tthe world.  Gnolls, bugbears, and centaurs all fit into this category. For those who were not pushed, the civilized races subjugated ","\t\tthem instead. Goblins, hobgoblins, and kobolds fit into this category.","\t</p>","\t<p>","\t\tAn increase in organized society also means that war is no longer an idle pastime for local lords.  Wars are now often massive ","\t\tdecade spanning conflicts between alliances of kingdoms. In these wars thousands if not millions of lives hang in the balance.","\t</p>","\t<p>","\t\tThis more 'civilized' world also brings danger for would-be adventurers. Kings and rulers are less likely to appreciate those ","\t\twho skirt the edges of the law for the greater good. Many of the civilized nations have regulated the use of magic. The","\t\tmorally-gray schools such as enchantment in particular is heavy regulated. Even so, many rulers owe their thrones to ","\t\talliances with the colleges of magic.  Magic can bring a significant martial advantage in battle. Rulers draw the ire ","\t\tof the colleges at great risk. A college backing a rebellion or pretender can mean the end of a dynasty.

The game Baldur's Gate had just come out. Baldur's Gate ","\t\tintroduced me and many of my friends to the world of Dungeons and Dragons for the first time. Role playing was a new and ","\t\tinteresting concept. We didn't have access to source materials or rules so we had to create our own. The original game ","\t\twe played was a loose LARP with few rules, but then again, we were in 7th grade. ","\t</p>","  \t<p>","\t\tAfter a couple of years we all moved on with our lives and stopped playing the game, but the world lived on in my head. ","\t\tIn high school I wrote a short story and then a (bad) novel taking place in the setting.  The main characters of the book ","\t\twere the ones my friends and I had conceived of back in middle school. The original materials will likely never see the ","\t\tlight of day.  Even so, I believe I still have the manuscript somewhere on my hard drive.","\t</p>","\t<p>","\t\tI undertook to rework the source material in college. I also started a rewrite of the book.  I hoped to use my somewhat ","\t\tincreased experience both in the genre and in writing to improve the work.

So far I have run 1 successful campaign in the setting, and am approaching the end of another campaign that has ","\t\tnow been underway for almost 2 years.
