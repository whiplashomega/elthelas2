# Chapter 3: Civil War

## Encounters in Cur'Estan

### Malia Takes Over the Refugee Camp

Malia will request Adam accompany her to the refugee camp on arrival at Cur'Estan. She will immediately demand a meeting with Jaxan Chin, and tell him she is taking over the camp. Jaxan will object. If Adam does not intervene a fight between the two may break out. Malia will not kill Jaxan, but will put him in his place.

### Flykr's Store

Eduard will report to Flykr that the store is going reasonably well. He hands over a profit of 200 gp, but mentions that some inventory has gone missing. Not enough to be a significant problem, but there is clearly a thief. He does not suspect Jazelle, but does have a few recent customers that he suspects. They are:

* Ogrun Firebreath - He was acting shifty when in the store. He is secretly a cross-dresser who likes to feel pretty, and so felt awkward when purchasing dresses for himself. This awkwardness made Eduard suspect him of the thefts. (Deception -1)
* Kyman Hexhammer - Eduard is aware that Kyman is a powerful member of the Black Sun. He was in the store purchasing disguises for some of his thieves and is not actually the thief. Suspected because he is a known criminal. His cover story is that he is buying the dresses for his lover. (Deception +10)
* Sara Grant - A middle aged woman who recently took up dancing. She is broke and came into the store to browse and dream of buying the nice silk dresses. Eduard is suspicious of her because she came in repeatedly but never actually bought anything. She doesn't want to admit that she can't afford the dresses, so she claims she was simply dissatisfied with the dresses available. (Deception +1)
* Olivia Munbridge - A young woman who doesn't dance but shoplifts for thrills. Eduard was suspicious of her just because he doesn't like teenagers and thinks they are nothing but trouble. In this case he was right. Olivia came into the store three times. Coincidentally always just after Sara Grant had been there. She always purchased something small, a bell, a pair of shoes, etc, and smuggled out the stolen dresses in her bag. If questioned she claims she hates dresses (true) and would never steal them (false, she likes the thrill). Deception +5.

### Reward Ceremony

General Heartbren will convene an official reward ceremony for the party members the morning after they arrive. The leaders of the party's orders will be there. Those who completed their personal missions will receive additional rewards from their leader.

* General Heartbren will reward the party 5000 gp each for successfully evacuating the city.
* James Lightbringer will reward Silas with a suit of Gleaming Orichalcum Plate, adorned with symbols of Alohim and the Lords of the Rising Dawn.
* Kyman Hexhammer will reward Fallon with an Amulet of Intelligence +2
* Malia Demonslayer will reward Adam with her Wand of Fire

#### Wand of Fire (wand, attunement)

This wand grants a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls when casting spells that do fire damage, and adds the wielders spellcasting modifier to the damage rolls of fire spells. It has 5 charges, and recovers 1d4+1 charges after a long rest. The wielder can use 1 charge to cast the spell Burning Hands, 2 charges to cast Scorching Ray, or 3 charges to cast Fireball.

## Orders

### General Heartbren's Orders

The influx of refugees has created a supply problem in Cur'Estan. In normal conditions we would transport goods via the Upper Yellow River from Cur'Mestin and the farming communities in western Dormania, but the Duchess of Cur'Mestin has blockaded the river due to our alliance with Empress Dormana. We need to end that blockade. If you can do it via diplomacy, wonderful, but if not, contact the Empresses loyalists in the city and find a way to break the blockade by force.

#### Amathera's Shield Orders

Rumor has it that the Duchess of Cur'Mestin, Genevieve Octavius, is in cahoots with devils who help prop up her rule in return for the souls of her people. I don't think I need to stress how grevious a crime that is. Bring an end to her rule, and expel the devils from the city.

#### Black Sun Orders

I have heard that an old associate of mine has been working for Duchess Octavius. Find Felix and convince him to switch sides.

#### Illustrious Guild of Merchant's and Fine Artisans Orders

There are rumors of a Purple Worm Nest near Cur'Mestin. Purple Worm eggs are incredibly valuable. Bring at least one back with you and we will pay you well for it.

#### Lord's of the Rising Dawn Orders

The Temple of Alohim in the city has been taken over by some strange cult. Expel the invaders and restore the clerics to their temple.

#### Shepherd's of the All-Mother

We have heard of an unprecedented opportunity in Cur'Mestin! Take this scroll to the leader of the Shepherd's in the city. He will need you to find and kill one of the Purple Worms that live nearby. We will then raise it as an uber-powerful undead slave! One we will use to create a grand new system of underground tunnels for transportation to rival even the dwarves!

## Traveling to Cur'Mestin

#### Travelling by Boat

When the party arrives at the river, the first ship to pass will be a keelboat, moving slowly upriver (slower than they can walk) and laden with cargo. They will be unwilling to take on armed passengers unless convinced. There are two crewmen, Captain Jack and his first mate Sparrow. They are carrying food to Northport, grain and dried meat.

The next boat to pass is the galley of Captain Mercedes Hawk. She is a pirate and a slaver looking to sell slaves to the orcs.  All of her slaves are below decks, rowing the boat. They are travelling half-speed due to the current, but Mercedes will offer to put her crew on double shifts for the right price. She offers passage at 50 gp per person, or 75 gp per person for double time.

She has 10 crewmen including herself.

The ship has 2 levels below decks, the first is the cargo hold and quarters, players will be given rooms on this level (3 rooms, 2 per room). The ship is carrying some cargo in the form of spices (that Mercedes looted off the ship the slaves below decks came from.) The bottom level is the rowing deck, the 30 slaves down there never come up, and are only mentioned as 'oarsmen'. Mercedes will inform the party that it is off-limits, and the hatch remains padlocked at all times. Captain Mercedes and her first-mate Robert (also the slave driver) are the only ones with keys. The lock is a DC 15 slight of hand check to unlock (with advantage if proficient with thieves tools, must have thieves tools to attempt) or a DC 20 strength check to break.

If the party does not investigate the lower deck on their own, the following things will happen, one per day if travelling at double speed, or one every other day if travelling at normal speed:

event 1: The party hears a scream from below decks echo through the ship.

event 2: There is a loud splash in the night as a crewman dumps a dead slave overboard. He responds to any questioning with 'just dumping the garbage'.

event 3: Robert comes up from below decks still wearing his black mask and carrying his whip (which has blood on it).

event 4: Robert calls the captain below decks saying there is a 'situation'. When the captain returns she is cleaning blood off her dagger. (If the party investigates here it is a slave that got loose from its chains and is holding a crewman hostage and demanding freedom).

## Carlyle Pt. 2

Shortly after arrival in Cur'Mestin (before entering the city). A raven will drop the hilt of a rapier in front of Flykr, then land on her shoulder, a letter in a tube tied to it's leg (similar to a messenger pigeon). The letter will say:

My Dearest Flykr,

It has been my deepest honor to watch you these weeks. Your beauty and grace continue to surpass all others. Please accept this gift, when combined with the blade shard you already carry it will help to protect you from all harm. While a part of me is always with you, I must venture onward to Strovenguard. The Raven on your shoulder is my good friend Quothe, so long as you hold to the hilt of this blade he will serve you with loyalty, showing you all of the love that, for now, I cannot.

Forever Yours,
Carlyle

<aside>
<h4>The Singing Rapier (2 pieces)</h4>

<p>When combined with the blade shard necklace makes a single magic weapon (broken rapier, functionally a dagger) that:</p>

<p>2/day grants a bonus to AC equal to spellcasting modifier, advantage on acrobatics checks, and an extra 10 ft of movement speed for 1 minute (as bonus action).</p>
<p>does 1d4 base damage.</p>
</aside>

## Cur'Mestin

### Locations

![map of cur'mestin](/images/maps/cities/curmestin.png)

#### 1\. Octavius Castle

Octavius Castle is the home of Genevieve Octavius and the seat of government for the duchy. It is an imposing fortress built by Dorman I as a staging base before his invasion of Kandor. Genevieve has spent considerable sums repairing and restocking the fortress in recent years.

#### 2\. The River Docks

The river docks of Cur'Mestin are a singular large complex near the main marketplace in the city. There are several huge warehouses nearby currently filled to the brim with supplies.

#### 3\. Temple of Dorman

The largest temple in the city, the local priests of Dorman have not taken a side in the conflict between Manius Aquila and Empress Dormana.

#### 4\. Temple of Alohim

The Temple of Alohim is a relatively minor temple in Cur'Mestin, and the few regular worshippers that go there have been alarmed at the recent changes in the doctrine, not to mention the sudden disappearance of the high priest. The lower priests claim he was simply recalled to Desadorel, but his family is still in town, so most don't believe them.

#### 5\. Temple of Sara

The temple of Sara in town serves the local farmers without getting involved in politics. The local grange meets in the temple every Mansday.

#### 6\. Temple of Maris

The priests of the temple of Maris have been vocal in their opposition to civil war, and particularly the blockade of Cur'Estan.

#### 7\. Loyalist's Hideout

Genevieve the Younger's loyalists meet in this restaurant to discuss plans to undermine the rebels. They regularly speak in codewords and passphrases, and most anyone who frequents the restaurant is aware that something fishy is going on with the duchesses daughter.

#### 8\. Purple Worm Nest

A few miles to the east of town, some miners accidentally broke through into a purple worm's nest a few months ago. The mine was abandoned after that, and various monsters have moved in instead.

### Important People

#### Genevieve Octavius.

The Duchess of Cur'Mestin was an early supporter of Manius Aquila. She has always been known as a power hungry woman. The third (and least favored) child of her father, the previous Duke Octavius, she had her elder siblings murdered in their sleep (although it was never proven). Then, frustrated by her father's continued long life, waited until he slighted her at a party, then challenged him to a duel. She defeated her father in 'fair' combat after he tripped on something he couldn't see, inheriting his titles and duchy.

After rising to power, Genevieve proceeded to consolidate it, swiftly replacing the counts and barons under her with men and women directly loyal to her. Her largest frustration has been her own wayward daughter (and heir).

#### Genevieve Octavius II.

Named by her mother in a pique of vanity, the younger Genevieve became enamored at a young age with a local priest of Cora. That priest soon died in suspicious circumstances (after her mother discovered their budding relationship), and young Genevieve put the pieces together. Her uncle and grandfathers deaths, the disappearances among those who opposed her mother's iron fisted rule, and her own lover. When her mother pledged to support Manius Aquila's rebellion and began publicly trafficking with devils, Genevieve began quietly communicating with the Empress, and organizing a resistance force among the peasantry.

The younger Genevieve is bright and capable, but foolhardy, believing ever brightly in Cora's doctrine that no cause is ever truly lost.

#### [Felix Crawford](/runner/felixcrawford&shieldguardian)

Felix is a young half-elf with a questionable past. He regularly works for the highest bidder, sometimes as a spy, sometimes as a diplomat. He honors his contracts, but takes it very personally when someone else fails to honor theirs. Has worked with Kyman Hexhammer in the past, though they are not currently on the best of terms. He has a shield guardian companion that rarely leaves his side. He is currently in the employ of Genevieve Octavius to root out the loyalists.

#### TODO: High Cleric of Alohim

#### TODO: Devil Second in Command

#### TODO: Erik Dawnblade

## Entering the City

There is a toll to enter the city of 10 gp, plus a premium determined by the collector at the gate. Weapons, armor, or other potentially dangerous goods are prohibited, and those entering are inspected for such items.

## Felix

The Duchess is not present in the castle, and Felix is handling her affairs of state, while being in direct contact with her via a hidden sending stone. The Duchess will not agree to open the trade route unless the party brings her the head of the loyalists leader. It is obvious that she is working with devils, as the guards in the castle have all been replaced by bearded devils. During the conversation a functionary will butt into the conversation and report that some of the townspeople are protesting the recent tax increase outside the castle. Felix will respond that Sir Dawnblade is in town and dealing with those issues is his job. The functionary will then leave.

## Encounter with Erik Dawnblade

If the party chooses to investigate the presence of Erik Dawnblade...

Sir Dawnblade is in town to help deal with the loyalists. If things get bad he will skip town, but minor issues like peasants protesting he deals with without mercy. If the party does not intervene, Dawnblade will simply use his swords special ability to cast 'Dawn', laying waste to the peasants in a flash of burning light.

## Contacting the Loyalists

## Orc Slaver's Seeking Flykr

## Rivals at Court

## The Purple Worm Nest

Mine entrance: The players enter the wormling tunnels through an established mine tunnel. The tunnel however has been weakened by purple worm tunnels in the area. The players enter through a normal cart tracked tunnel when the tunnel begins to crumble and they fall through into a worms tunnel. You can have there be a save for damage but since this is a scripted event I tend not to have that. The original tunnel they were on is now fully blocked and collapsed.

Worm tunnel: All paths lead to the next eventually, but they players can choose their next encounter. In one path leads to a strange underground garden that has 2 shambling mounds that attack the passer’s by. The other direction seems to have small tunneler tracks in it, which leads to the grick layer.

More choices: The next tunnel has 3 branches each with different creatures for the players to find. Basilisks down one tunnel that can be detected by finding a miner that has turned to stone. Carrion crawlers which can be detected by seeing a few devoured corpses that have traces of the paralyzing poison on them. Or a couple bulettes that can be detected by noticing the type of tunnel has changed to be dug by a bulette.

Failed summoning: The players stumble upon a recently wiped out cult of kobolds that were trying to resurrect their former master that died years ago. During their failed ritual they managed to summon a gauth, a beholder type creature that sneaks through poorly done ritauls. The gauth has resurrected some of the kobolds as zombies, and tries to devour the magical energy of the players. During the battle they can hear a loud commotion from the tunnel ahead that sounds like a purple worm fighting something.

The nest: Within the nest itself there is a drider with a legion of spiders. Though the drider had a giant army of giant spiders to help they attracted the attention of a purple worm which they barely fought off with heavy casualties. One of the purple worms lie dead in its nest, it's body mutilated and unusable, the gems already having been looted and taken away. The drider wants the worm eggs for some reason, and does not take kindly to the players trying to take their hard earned prize.
