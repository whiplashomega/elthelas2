Since then those trapped on the islands have become the most adept sailors in the world, finding safety and wealth on the sea. The others have found homes in both mountains and plains, and have formed a caste-based republic.\n\nThis has split the dwarves into 4 distinct sub-races, that although they are capable of interbreeding, rarely do.\n\n#### Dwarven Culture in Elthelas\n\nThe Dwarves of Elthelas have a deep affinity for underground and contained spaces. Deep in the vaults of the earth, where light is a rare and expensive thing, art rarely takes the form of the visual, though dwarven stonework and sculpture is often of an incredible caliber. Instead music, particularly singing, are greatly valued. Complicated overlapping resonances fill the caverns, and the choirs of Dorun's faithful are unparalleled. The challenges of an underground life also meant dwarves were the first to invent the water-powered and wind up clocks in Elathia.  Productivity and stoicism are highly valued, as is good order. Many terms common among humans are reversed for dwarves. Darkness is considered good and safe, where light is associated with fear, exposure and death. Phrases like 'moving up in the world' are reversed to 'moving down in the world' as how deep in the earth one lives is associated with status. The acquisition of wealth, particularly in the form of precious metals and gems, approaches the status of religion among the dwarves, such that many of the caste restrictions that exist are centered around methods of acquiring wealth such as restrictions on owning wealth generating property, using banking services, etc.\n\nAnother unusual aspect among dwarven cultures in Elthelas is their tendency towards republicanism.  Both Curinor and Morrindim are governed by semi-democratic representative bodies. Their is no true landed nobility among the dwarves, and those who manage to become wealthy have as much political clout as those who were born to it.\n\n#### Cultural differences among the Morrind\n\n The Morrindim share most of the basic cultural traits with other dwarves of Elthelas, except that they have dropped the traditional caste system.  Access to vehicles of wealth generation is more open in Morrind society.  Similarly the Morrind place less emphasis on living deep within the earth. While the terminology and tradition of 'dark/deep' being equated with 'good' remains, the leaders of Morrind society spend their whole lives in the sun aboard ships.","traits":["Size: Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 lbs.

However, theological texts claim them as the patron people of the nature goddess Gaian, who brought them to Elthelas to be stewards of the deep forests.\n\n#### Faelin Culture in Elthelas\n\n The Faelin's culture revolves around matrilineal family groups. Often an extended family of up to 30-40 Faelin will live together, with the eldest matriarch given an outsized influence in decision making. Young men who come of age will visit nearby family groups until they meet their future spouse, then joining her family group where they will live for the rest of their lives. Divorce is unheard of among the Faelin. Beyond their family group, the Faelin almost universally dedicate themselves to serving the will of Gaian. Those who leave Gnarra typically do so on some mission or other from the Awakened Goddess. A Faelin treehouse is typically built in the canopy of the tallest trees of the Gnarra jungle, often 100 ft or more off the ground, and forming a massive complex throughout the branches of the tree.

Perhaps the only people in Elthelas to revere both Sylvan and Dorun, the Goliath's focus on their elemental aspects as the gods of air and earth rather than their more racially tinted domains. Goliaths are taught to always move with care, and to consider their actions carefully, a stance that has kept them safe from repercussions in a world where they are greatly outnumbered everywhere they live. Though they are often viewed as backwards or barbaric by outsiders, typically because their remote mountain homes preclude farming and thus permanent settlement, the Goliaths have a varied and full society.

They are slightly taller than humans, and much more muscular, with green to mottled brown skin, large noses, a prominent brow-ridge and an underbite featuring tusks. While they are stereotyped as being stupid, evil, and cruel, only the last 2 are usually true. They are also the most populous race in the world save humans, and had they the same room to expand, they probably would have outbred humans long ago.\n\nOrcs are also generally tribal, and orcish society revolves around rule by the strongest. Unfortunately this does not lead to stable societies, but rather warlords who rise and fall, usually within a few years, and who war amongst themselves. These warlords are generally High Orcs, a breed that has long separated itself from their kin, favoring skill in leadership or sorcerous magic over pure brute strength. Far to the south, in Nerim, the Sand Orc tribes roam.\n\n#### Orc Culture in Elthelas\n\nThe Orcs in Elthelas are far more organized and varied than orcs in most settings. Their tendency towards chaos has been tempered by a natural respect for strength and a natural willingness to follow those who are stronger than they. This enables strong and ambitious warlords who can persuade others to follow them to build up strength and power. Their vast territory of fertile land also means that they developed farming, culture, and civilization right alongside the other nations of the world. While they lack a natural prediliction towards feats of the mind, building a great building can be seen as a sign of strength just as much as personal combat. Their numerical superiority over their early neighbors, the goblinoids and gnolls, enabled them to dominate these other races, enslaving them or otherwise manipulating them towards their own ends.\n\nOrc culture is focused on achieving personal strength and skill. Every town of size has regular gladiatorial tournaments, where warriors, both free and slave, compete against each other. Success in the tournaments is considered an excellent way to attract a mate, for both men and women, and comes with substantial prizes that can help to jumpstart a new household. Farming among the orcs focuses on the raising of livestock, particularly pigs, chickens, or other animals that require little feed to raise to adulthood.\n\nMedicine and magic among the orcs is most often practiced by witch doctors living on the fringes of society, or elites who use their sorcery to outwit their peers.  The church of Mat'raktha always has a firm hand in the order of society, intervening when clan wars become hot enough to threaten the cohesion of orcish society, and demanding the proper rights from any warlord who wishes to sit on the council in Marinval. A cleric may be consulted by both sides in a clan dispute before hostilities progress to blood, and that cleric may suggest alternative remedies to all-out war, such as a gladiatorial bout between clan champions, or a peace settlement to prevent a larger clan from wiping out a weaker one.","traits":["Size: Orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall.

They often bear demonic traits, such as horns, forked tails or tongue, or reddish skin or eyes. They also tend towards evil more than the average person, and although this is far from a given, it is common enough that the distrust that follows them everywhere is justified.\n\nTieflings are not quite as rare as Aasimar (given demons' proclivity for lust), although they are still rare enough to cause a stir in any town they show up in, especially given their heritage. Tieflings are more common in the west, where demons, and demon attacks, are also more common. Tieflings of a good or neutral persuasion can usually find shelter in Dera'Dragorim or Zelfir, the second as a service to Amathera as a pity of their natural plight, and the first in recognition of a shared victimization at the hands of aggressive demon invaders.\n\n#### Tiefling Culture in Elthelas\n\nThe distrust that tieflings face at the hands of common folk, combined with the chaos in their blood, leads many to take up life as an adventurer or wanderer. Some find their way to the tiefling enclaves in more friendly cities, while many find themselves taken advantage of by evil lords who give them opportunities where no one else would. The largest population of settled Tiefling's in Elthelas is in the Deran city of Vasha. There it is common enough to see someone with horns or a forked tongue walking down the street that few pay it any mind. The Tiefling's there have found a niche working as alchemists, smelters and smiths, as well as other jobs where their natural resistances give them an edge over an ordinary human. These Tieflings are well integrated into Dera'Dragoran society.\n\nElsewhere in the world tieflings have evolved their own counter cultures. For example, In Malinval Tieflings are subject only to the church of Mat'raktha, and have a near monopoly on intercity trade, since they are the only race not subject to the warlords or mandatory slavery.","traits":["Ability Score Increase: Your intelligence score increases by 1 and your charisma score increases by 2.","Size: Tieflings have about the same size and build as humans.

Strong and hardy, they are somewhat larger than an orc, and have clawed hands.\n\nThe trollkin were originally created during the dawning years of the world as a magical experiment in interracial breeding. The end result was something akin to a fast maturing, highly stunted troll, and was cast out by its Sorceron creators as a failure and released into the wild. Yet the trollkin's improved intellect in comparison to their troll progenitors, ability to breed quickly, and fit into other societies (with a bit of care and luck), enabled the Trollkin to thrive where trolls were hunted and killed. During the God's War, the trollkin were conscripted as foot soldiers into the armies of every side, and by the end of the war, only a few hundred remained alive. Nevertheless, these few hundred managed to find a land of their own on a large island that they named Degak'Ta, and from there they have spread out to various lands once again.\n\nThe trollkin, unlike every other major race on Elthelas, are naturally antitheistic. They generally feel the Gods betrayed their people in the God's War, using them as pawns, sending them to their deaths, and in the end, providing no reward. Politically, they tend to discount charisma as useless, rewarding strength and cunning. In their homeland of Degak'Ta they are ruled by the military, lead by the Grand Marshal, who gains office through contests of strength and tactics. In foreign affairs they are generally aloof, not taking sides in conflicts as a people, and instead hire out individually or in small groups as mercenaries to either or any side, and they are highly valued as such.\n\n","traits":["Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 1 and your Constitution Score increases by 2.","Size: Trollkin range from 7 feet to 8.5 feet tall, and typically weigh between 250 and 350 lbs.
