Town of Port Swift

The players arrive in the small trade town of Port swift, where they are “met” by Okil. She sneaks up on them and holds a stick to one of their throats before commenting on their lack of awareness and skill. Okil will mention that passage into the town of Cur’mestin is restricted, and the players must figure out a way into town.

Getting into Cur’mestin

Players have several option for this task which Okil will elaborate on as needed.

•	They can attempt to disguise themselves as merchants and Okil will forge the needed documents.
•	They can attempt to ford the river at night and sneak in.
•	They can attempt to enter through the towns sewers, but they are infested.
•	They could attempt to scale the walls, but must avoid the watchmen
•	They are welcome to come up with their own plan

On the inside

Once inside Cur’mestin the players need to find a safe house to stay at. Okil has a few suggestions.

•	A fellow thief that she has worked with before (Perfectly loyal, but annoyed by the players)
•	A Dormanian loyalist that was a part of the loyalist movement and escaped. (Is a traitor and will sell them out)
•	Her favorite butcher, he hands out free jerky. (Loyal but also afraid of the devils)
•	An abandoned warehouse. Not very comfortable but livable. (Will be discovered later)
•	A devil soldier that Okil sometimes bribes for information (Works out fine)

The situation in Cur’mestin

Once set-up, Okil will brief them on the full situation going on in town.

•	Manius listens to an Erinyes named Anageth. She appears to be the one actually in charge
•	Manius works from his castle, and almost never leaves.
•	Manius’ castle is impossibly guarded, all attempts to sneak in have failed as he keeps imp gaurds in every corridor. 
•	Manius has regular contact with his patron, and from what little info they have gained on the topic, his patron is very displeased with Manius’ lack of progress.
•	Devil’s roam the street both opening and in disguise.
•	Manius has several tactics to root out those still loyal to the regular Dormanian empire.

Okil proposes her plan to gain more information about Manius by going through his lieutenants and other ranking officers. The players are welcome of course to come with their own ideas, which Okil will give her honest feedback on and will help with as best she can.

Okil will tell the party about the 6 potential canditates for squeeze for info.

•	The true leader Anageth. She leaves regularly to deliver new orders to the other superiors. She should be saved for last or ignored due to her power and influence. She can be found giving new orders during weekly meetings that they hold with all the other ranking memebers.
•	A mysterious sergeant named Baorvex that doesn’t seem to hold any actual position or command. Though other devils seem to be slightly afraid of him. He goes to the shipping yard every day and talks with someone different in private. About what I have no idea.
•	The executioner Kartina. She wields a magical greataxe and performs the near daily public executions. She doesn’t have much contact with the higher ups but is popular with the rank and file of the other devils.
•	The Defense lawyer Fierna. she does her best to try and prove peoples innocence during the public executions. Though there is little law left in this city, she will occasionally save someone by proving their innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt, or by finding someone else that will confess to the crime (typically a spouse that wishes to save their husband/wife). Though she is a friend of the people in most respects she does technically work for the Manius and has access to the castle.
•	The false idol Meritos. He holds regular sermons to Dorman’s glory. Manius has no love for Dorman but it is still the official religion and he has always been a fan of maintaining appearances. The sermons are actually a trap to root out those who are overly loyal to dorman and potential clerics. He also holds a phony confessional to get people to admit to crimes. Meritos always maintains an image of innocence during these sermons, even when the devils “unexpectedly” swoop in.
•	The folk hero Willum. Willium won the hearts of the people when he single handedly fought off a group of bandits attacking a wealthy family. Since then he has been a model soldier and citizen, and very loyal to Manius. Willum is ignored by the devils and he is respected by the townfolk. Though some suspect the real Willum is dead and the current one is a devil in disguise.

Make sure the game lasts longer

Players should not find the information they seek from the first three suspects (exluding Anageth). Instead they should be either a devil in disguise, know nothing or be too loyal to get any useful information out of. When they do get to someone with good info, this what they can learn.

•	Manius is completely terrified of his patron, and has had recent panic attacks about him.
•	Everyone is more loyal to Manius’ patron that Manius himself
•	Manius always does absoulutly everything that his patron says without question.
•	Manius’ patron is fond of the big manion estates that humans build.
•	The one time that Manius’ patron appeared, he took over the biggest house in town.
•	The biggest house is owned by the Cardisel’s, who are avid devil worshipers.
•	Manius always brings a good size of cambions to guard him when he leaves.
•	When Manius’ patron arrived, he did so in a huge fiery explosion

From Anageth they learn

•	The name of Manius’ actual patron. From there they can learn more details about him and his personality by consulting a library or someone knowledgable.
•	Where Manius’ keeps his method for contact his patron.

From the last person, if they decide to go above and beyond, they learn about Manius’ secret stash of money and treasure.

Okils plan

After letting the players consider their options, and if they seem like they cannot solve the problem with their own idea, Okil will propose her idea. They should stage the arrival of Manius’ patron, who will then take up residence in the biggest house (the player will have to clear it out first) and summon Manius to him. They players should set a trap in the house so that Manius cannot escape.

Okil’s true intentions

Okil has been after Maniu’s communication artifact for this entire mission. Once the players begin the plan, Okil says she will hide in the chandelier and drop on Manius for a surpise attack once he is lured to the house. In reality she leaves and goes to the castle to steal the artifact. If the players hurry after her once the mission is complete, they can catch her in the act with the item. She has been stalled by having to disable traps and kill mooks along the way. Okil will try to talk her way out of trap, or will sneak off if that doesn’t work. A good persuasion or deception check can convince her to turn it over and join the cause as well.

  Players should level up to level 10 at the end of this chapter.
