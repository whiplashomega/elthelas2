The fortress of Cur'Estan was an old abandoned keep in the woods of Kandor, first built during Dorman I war with the dwarves over their eastern holds as a supply dump and staging area for the imperial army. When the founders of the Black Wolf Irregulars discovered it, they bought it from the lumberjacks who owned the land and after making their fortune adventuring, set about restoring the fortress.\n\nWith the recent breakup of the Alliance of 6 Nations, Kandor remains the only reliable funding nation for the Black Wolf Irregulars.  Meanwhile their numbers have been decimated as they repeatedly have attempted to shore up defenses and weak points on the southern borders, only to have the orcs overwhelm them.  Only one of their founding members remains alive, General Gerad Heartbren, a now aging Moon Elf desparate to save a world crumbling around him.\n\nGeneral Heartbren has put out a call for recruitment, and is rapidly burning through what remains of his personal fortune, to make Cur'Estan into a new beacon of hope for all those who hope to stop the spread of evil in the world.","coords":[56.511017504952164,81.91818237304689]},{"name":"Dal Okra","description":"Literally in Orcish \"Dal Okra\" means Home of the Orcs. It is an ancient name for the place of legend where the orc race was first created. Whether that was actually the huge black mountain called Dal Okra today is a question for debate, as that history was lost in the God's War. Dal Okra today is a huge empty tomb, once holding the Prince of Fiends, a believed dead Sorceron, who once commanded at least part of the orc legions in the God's War before he was struck down by Michael, the Archangel of Alohim. Now he is awake again, and has taken nearly complete control of the orcish tribes.","coords":[0.7031073524364909,63.81271362304688]},{"name":"Dera","description":"Once the capital of the Deran empire, now an ancient ruin destroyed by demons.

The mountain is home to an extensive system of natural caves, which they have greatly enlarged, and several cool springs that supply an abundance of water. As such it serves as trading post and wintering location for the Sand Orcs. It is also the location their chiefs meet in order to discuss any matters that involve all of the tribes. It is a place of peace, and no sand orc is allowed to raise a hand against another while at or near Fang.","coords":[-55.92458580482952,92.90451049804688]},{"name":"Fortress of Light","description":"The Fortress of Light is a massive joint venture defensive fortress and staging facility manned by dwarves, humans, and elves from Gerasalim, Dormania, Kandor, Curinor, Demal Thor, and Eldoran. It is the central supply dump and gathering point for campaigns and troop movements in the defense against attacking orcs, trolls, gnolls, and various goblinoids coming across arid plain known as the Blighted Gap.\n\nThe fortress itself is built surrounding a small springfed lake, and covers nearly 3 square miles. It's outer wall extend up 150 feet of sheer stone braced with adamantium, without joint or crack, and they are nearly 15 foot thick. Several large inner keeps, built similarly to the outer wall, extend up some 200-250 feet. Large counterspelling crystals instantly counter any spell cast at or near the fortress. A dry moat, filled with thick steel spikes, extends out 25 feet from the edge of the wall.\n\nAfter the second fall of Aridhem, and the withdrawal of elven and dormanian armies, the Fortress of Light found itself without sufficient soldiers to man the walls, and cut off from resupply. It took only a month for the orcs to breach the walls and take the fortress after that point. Although the defenders inflicted massive casualties on the orcs, they were slaughtered to a man.\n\nNow the Fortress is the forward base of orcish operations in the north.","coords":[14.604847155053898,70.58029174804689]},{"name":"Gaia's Grove","description":"The Dreaming Goddess, Gaia, Who Dreams No More.

It was a massive public works project that employed nearly 300,000 people during a period of relative peace for the Empire and construction took 23 years.\n\nDorman III began construction in 1524 after his requests for aid from the college during the Nerim Cataclysm took months to arrive.  When he died in battle against the orcs in 1530 his brother, Dorman IV took the throne and continued the project.

The unwalled and poorly defended city, far from the war fronts the orcs were used to fighting on, was quickly overrun. Those who did not escape were killed, and while the undead were driven back and eventually destroyed, the Champions of Cora who led the charge felt no pity for the Mat'raktha worshipping orcs, and bypassed the city on their way to Nerim.
