  "description": "My Elthelas Campaign Setting website rebuilt on the MEAN stack.  This is my personal side-project for learning new concepts and ideas, and so has taken various forms over its life.  In an effort to save hard-drive space I have rebased from this repo: https://github.com/whiplashomega/elthelas which hosts my older Symfony based version of the site, as well as an earlier version of this code from when I was still planning to use Symfony as the API backend for this code.  Symfony proved to be frustrating to work with from a headless standpoint, particularly in implementing user login and handling server routing.",
